{"question": "I am not gaining muscle mass though I take fatty foods. Why? I eat chicken every week two to three times but I did not get the fat. My weight is 60 kg and my age is 19 years but everything which I eat is like a cold drink which is helpless for me.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I understand you want to gain mass to your lean body. A combination of right diet and right exercise can help you gain mass at the right places without becoming fat also. It is important to develop mass at the right place so that you put on weight healthily and look good as well. Your BMI (body mass index) is less than what is required for your physique. However, there is no cause to worry. You are a tall young man in your teens (19 years), hence you would have attained your sudden growth spurt a year or two back. Understand that boys grow suddenly in their late teens when they do not put much weight and hence appear very slim. That is what has happened in your case. For gaining mass, your dietary intake should be more than what the body burns. Also, you must do adequate weight training to improve your muscle strength. To improve your weight follow these suggestions. 1. Take two whole eggs in the morning and two egg whites in the evening. You may increase egg whites in the morning or evenings to a maximum of four or five. 2. Drink plenty of milk and eat nutritious healthy home food. 3. When eating non-vegetarian food prefer boiled meat to fried items. Fish is healthier than other meat. 4. Drink at least four to five liters of water daily, even during winters when you do not feel thirsty. 5. Buy some weights at home and start working out. Find out the right exercises for you, you may find it on the internet various home exercises catering to specific muscle groups. 6. When you exercise one muscle group, give it rest for two days which you may exercise some other muscle group. 7. You may even enroll in a good gym with a physical trainer or instructor who can guide you with exercise machines and what exercises you must do. 8. Before work-out and after work-out take a protein shake (or a milkshake in the beginning days). 9. Incorporate a lot of fruits, vegetables, greens, and salad in your daily diet, so that you consume a balanced nutritious diet complete in every way. You can get detailed advice regarding diet if you contact a dietician who we have in our panel in iCliniq itself. They can guide you with the right protein powders, the ingredients in a diet for gaining mass at your age. I hope this helps."}

Many thanks for your help and support.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. I will try to remain as simple as possible in my conversation so that everything is pretty much clear and easy understandable to you. I have seen the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values in your attached laboratory reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I appreciate the efforts you put in to upload the reports. I want to add that on looking only the PSA values in this range concludes nothing. We usually take this first reading as a baseline result and compare future results with this PSA level to see if the values are going up or down. The future values when compared to this reference baseline value, give us a clue if there is any disease and its progression or regression. Only the PSA levels especially the ones you presented in attachments never concludes that it is a prostate cancer. Urologist has to take complete history to see if there is some blockage to urine flow due to enlargement of prostate. Actually prostate gland has a tough and non-expandable covering capsule around it. If there is any growth as a tumor inside this gland, it causes a pressure on the urethra. The urethra (urine pipe) is passing through this prostate gland en route to penis opening. Any local lesion causes the urethra to get obstructed causing issues with flow of urine (urinary symptoms). Urologists may also go for serial diagnostic tests and radiological imaging studies to see if there is an abnormal growth inside. So an in-person evaluation from an urologist is necessary and to keep a follow up is the best strategy as I think he will go for look and see policy. He will go for a conservative approach or as appropriate. Follow up may be done after 6-8 weeks for redoing the laboratory investigations and all that. Regarding thrombosed hemorrhoids, I want to explain that it is a different disease and has little to absolutely no relation with the prostate as is in this patient. Treatment given by the physician for hemorrhoids is all good to go without any change. Sometimes we have to send the patient for surgical resection of the thrombosed vein area. You have not uploaded pictures of the anus. Otherwise, I may have been in a better position to assist you in its management options that best suits in this specific patient. I also want to see and know the color of the anal lesion. Picture will also help to decide whether it is a healing or a non-healing hemorrhoid. Also please add, how long has he been having hemorrhoids? And since when these thrombosed veins are there? If there is still burning or any kind of discomfort in anal area, I suggest you to apply ProCort rectal ointment outside and inside using a special applicator that comes with the ointment. 1. Avoid constipation. Keep a judicious supply of fluids. 2. Bland diet is best for him. 3. Physical activity is necessary as much as possible easily.

{"question": "Is it normal to get dryness in the nostril? About 16 days ago I started getting dryness in my left nostril only. Mucus felt like super glue.

I scheduled another appointment about a week later when the symptoms still had not gone away. I realized when I used a Q-Tip to clean my nose in that nostril that I would get blood (not a nosebleed). It was on the inside of the Q-Tip only so it was a specific area in the back of my nose. I was getting an aching pain on that side of my face. The doctor gave me Amox and Flonase, I took the Amoxicillin for five days and am still using the Flonase. The congestion has definitely improved, but I am still getting inconsistent blood when I touch that area, light aching that is inconsistent or when I cough that I can feel in the left sinus. Left nostril still feels sticky. I am 35 years old, I smoked off an on for about 6 to 7 years (have not touched a cigarette in about four years). I used oral tobacco for about 3 to 4 years (have not used in two years now) and I vaped for about two years (stopped about 14 days ago).

Medofloxine is a Fluoroquinolone. In case you cannot find it in your country you can use Moxifloxacin 400 mg for ten days which is a Fluoroquinolone too. Also, you need to add a mucolytic to liquify the mucus inside your sinus. Continue the Flonase.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

The best way to get this clarified is with a visual fields test or perimetry. This also happens to be the very same test that is done for people diagnosed as \"glaucoma suspects\" before taking any decisions on treatment/management. If you do feel that people are thinking that you are staring at them, then you must check to see if your eyes are crossed outwards. This deviation can be episodic, so detecting it may be difficult. A simple test you can do at home to check if your eyes are crossing out is the Hirschberg's test. You will need the help of a friend or a family member to do this. While sitting straight and looking at a distant object, ask your friend to sit directly in front of you and shine a torchlight at the bridge of your nose and look at the reflection of light on the black portion of both your eyes. If it is exactly in the middle of each black part, then your eyes are straight, if not then they are crossed and you may have to see a doctor regarding this. I hope this helps. Review after one week.

{"question": "Is it possible to get depression due to SLE? I am a 22-year-old female diagnosed with SLE at age 18. I have a difficult time concentrating and keeping my focus on things that I have to do. On some days I have trouble falling asleep and almost every day I have trouble getting a good night's sleep. I feel myself tossing and turning throughout the night. I try to get an adequate amount of exercise in throughout the week and walk almost every day. I know that chronic diseases can lead to depression but I can honestly say that it is not knowing that I have a disease that makes me feel unhappy. I just feel like I am mentally unstable sometimes. Sometimes it feels that everyday life situations are a lot more stressful to me than they used to be. And I feel like I am always on the verge of a mental breakdown. I have been feeling depressed off and on for at least two years. My lupus has been totally under control with the Plaquenil that I take daily. My BP runs a slightly over the normal at about 125/84, resting pulse in low 70's and BS WDL.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I can understand what you are going through, and I will try to be as helpful as possible. There are two possibilities: 1. The depression is not because of lupus but comorbidity. This is likely if there is a family history of depression. 2. Plaquenil could have some contribution to your problems. Insomnia is a known side effect of it. So, you can try taking it in the morning if you are taking it at night. Also, there are case reports of mood changes secondary to Hydroxychloroquine. Since your lupus is so nicely controlled with Plaquenil, it would not be wise to stop the drug just because of this. What I will recommend is to take it, first thing in the morning. A good sleep could in itself have a mood stabilizing and elevating effect. If this does not help much, you could ask your doctor for an antidepressant which promotes sleep. Agomelatine is one such drug that comes to mind, but it needs regular liver check-ups and has interactions with Ciprofloxacin, Omeprazole, Lorazepam, and Fluvoxamine. I could not find a known interaction with Plaquenil but I think your rheumatologist is the ideal person to ask. If mood swings are your major issue, a mood stabilizer could help. Take care."}

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density.

{"question": "Can Althea cypriterone acetate ethinyl estradiol help in preventing pregnancy? Due to an accident, I had unsafe sex. I went to the pharmacy to get a EPC or morning-after pill.

But at the same time you should understand that emergency pills are not 100 % safe and there is up to 30% chance of failure. But have only option after unprotected sex. When you stop taking tablets than there can be withdrawal bleeding within 7 days. And your cycle can be irregular for 1 or 2 periods if you are not pregnant. Best way to confirm whether pills worked or not is to wait for 15 days atleast and do urine pregnancy test on kit and see. If turns to be positive than you are pregnant and if negative than pills worked well. Do drink more water. Chance of failure is because pills worked by stopping ovulation but if ovulation already happened than it will not work. So have to wait and watch after taking pills."}

{"question": "Is there a permanent cure for abdomen pain caused by uterus fibroids? My sister is 46 years old now. She got married 17 years back and have a girl child of age 15. For nearly 10 years, she is having abdominal pain, which will occur during the periods and will last for five days. It will start two days before periods and will last three or four days after it. The pain will be more and sometimes intolerable. It will not even reduce with painkiller and the pain will be more during night-time with the following symptoms. Lack of appetite, lower abdominal pain, breathing difficulty, indigestion, bolting and constipation. All these symptoms will persist until the pain is there. She had been frequently visiting doctors for treatment, but the doctor says that she has no major problem in the stomach. She was diagnosed with fibroid 10 years back and the size was small. The doctors also said that the fibroid will not have pain as she feel. Whenever the pain is more she used to visits the hospital. It will be six to seven visit a year and yearly once she will be treated with antibiotics for severe infection. During her last period 30 days back the pain started and did not reduce until now. The pain was so severe and for the last four days she had mild fever. So, she visited a doctor and he advised for a CT scan. After seeing the results he suggested to immediately go for surgery and advised to get her uterus removed and also said she might have cancer. When we went for a second opinion to another doctor, she said there is some uterus infection and advised medicine for that and asked to come back after two weeks. I have attached the CT scan and report, kindly comment on it. Based on the results, is there a chance of cancer, which the local doctor has said? The problem exists for nearly 10 years and many times due to intolerable pain, she used to roll on the floor, Is there any permanent cure for it? I have attached the prescription too. Can we continue it or should go for further investigations? Why infections reappear yearly? As advised by the local doctor, is removal of the uterus is necessary? Will it give a permanent solution?

For pancreatic lipoma, you should get a second opinion on this with gastroenterology specialists before planning fibroid surgery. Vaginal infections can be tackled easily. It is not a major concern.

{"question": "What is the influence of cocaine on heart rate? For the past two months, I have had a pretty consistent elevated heart rate. Not by a lot but noticeable for me compared to what I was coming from. I cut out alcohol and caffeine and that helped but it always returns. My resting heart rate (I wear an Apple watch) is pretty consistent in the 53-58 range. But when I get up, go up or downstairs, it will jump to 100 pretty fast, then average out in the 80's as I move about my day. When I am sitting at work it is 78-85 bpm. This is a good 8-10 bpm faster than when I am at peak health. I am not sure what is going on. I did a fair bit of cocaine and took some ED pills a few times (with the cocaine) before three months, so I wondered if maybe there is a connection. I have not done anything like that since then. I am a runner, but now when I run or jump it goes up to 150 bpm and higher pretty fast. If I push myself anywhere close to hard I am at 170-180 bpm pretty easily, so I slow down. And it seems my body does not recover quite as fast. So I have stopped running hard and just do light jogs, and play tennis. I recover pretty easily there. But it is annoying as I want to run and push myself. I will go two to three days with no caffeine, alcohol and then I notice my walking around rate is lower, like what it used to be mid 70's. When it is like that I can feel it noticeably, I feel much more complete and whole. I feel great and no shortness of breath. So then I will have a few glasses of wine that night, and maybe a dessert (I like sugar at night) and I will lay down to sleep and my heart seems to jump up to 85-95 bpm for a while and it takes two to three hours before it rests at 53-58 bpm. And then the cycle starts again. I am so confused I do not know what the deal is. Is it the alcohol or sugar? I drink this one type of white wine a lot but I have noticed my heart rate does not react as much when I just drink beer. One night, I had white wine then tequila and my resting rate was like 68-78 bpm all night. I saw a doctor about three weeks ago and they did an ECG and listened to my heart and it showed no issues or irregularities. I do not have heart pain, though I did have a few sharp pains over the past two months maybe two to three times all lasting about one second and then it is gone all when I am lying down in bed trying to go to sleep. I do have shortness of breath due to the elevated heart rate when I am carrying stuff, going upstairs, etc. I do not have pain in my chest, jaw, left arm, etc. Sorry, this is so long but I really would love to discuss this with someone who maybe has heard of this before. To be clear what is annoying and confusing me is that my heart rate will steadily be 8-10 bpm higher at all times (aside from resting rate) for like a 7-10 days before it feels like it goes back to normal. But then there is always something that sets it off again. I never see it spike over 105 or so.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Welcome to icliniq.com. I understand your concern, but I assure you that there is nothing to worry about. It is normal for the human heart rate to fluctuate. For instance, during exercise the heart rate can go as high as 350 bpm in some people it does not mean there is a problem. It is normal. It is also normal for the heart rate to slow down when laying down. But it can increase while laying down in cases where you take alcohol just like in your case. You are having issues with anxiety probably because of the cocaine you used. I advise you to resume your exercise. Start jogging, it will help with your situation.

{"question": "Is it possible to cure nasal polyps and inflammed sinus that are affecting smell?

The loss of smell sensation with you can be because of the polyps which prevent the air to reach the olfactory mucosa in the roof of your nose or because of a viral attack. I advise you to take antiviral medicine as Acyclovir tablets. Its dose is five tablets all over one day only. Continue your Avamyse spray till polyps disappear. If the Avamays spray does not end the polyposis you have to perform a surgery to remove polyps. When the smell nerves are injured, it cannot be healed completely again. We just save the remaining part of the sensation. In your case, I think it is smarter of time that you can smell again but not in a normal way as before. Just treat polyps first then we will see."}

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy.

So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks.

{"question": "I have pain in the rigth root canal molar tooth on taking warm foods. Why? I got a root canal and crown several years ago in two molars, one on each side of my jaw. The crowns are metal with light porcelain on the outside. The teeth have felt fine ever since, until a few days ago. Now I feel pain in the right molar tooth whenever some warm food touches it. The pain takes a second or two to come, it is not instant on contact. Cold food or drinks cause no pain, neither does chewing. The gums around the crowned teeth are irritated, and look like they are possibly pulling down away from the teeth as I can see the dark metal underpart at the gum line. The tooth on the left side does not hurt at all aside from the irritated look of the gums around it. After doing some reading, I think a possibility is that the root canal did not get all the pulp in the right side tooth, and that is now infected again. I do not currently have dental or medical insurance and it may be a few months later I can see a dentist. What can I do in the meantime to take care of the tooth? I also became aware that I grind and click my teeth a lot without realizing it, and possibly at night when I sleep. My front teeth all look worn down now. This is concerning me a lot. I looked into teeth guards for sleeping, but the ones I found in stores need to be heated and placed between teeth to shape them to my mouth, and with my current heat sensitivity I can not use them.", "prediction": "For further information consult a dentist online -->", "reference": "I have read your query and it is pretty much clear that the right molar with history of RCT (root canal treatment) is causing the pain. Now the causes of pain may be a re-infection or incomplete RCT, but there can be other causes as well. As you mentioned you have bruxism (teeth grinding), the tooth or in this case the RCT tooth is under continuous insult from the grinding habit. This may have also caused the injury to the surrounding tissues. A prosthetic crown or porcelain crown here if not in occlusion may also be another cause for the pain. Now as you mentioned that you are having pain only on taking warm foods and liquid diet and the gums around the crown is receding (recession), it looks like you might be having tooth sensitivity in the nearby tooth due to the dentin exposure caused by recession. An x-ray of the tooth will make the things more clear as if a new RCT is required or you just need proper cleaning and fluoride toothpaste. If it is possible, do upload a picture of the tooth and also x-ray of the tooth. Meanwhile, I would suggest you to use fluoride-containing toothpaste and ultrasoft toothbrush. Do not scrub, clean your teeth and gums gently. Maintain good oral health."}
{"question": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner-lining will fall off.

{"question": "My tooth become sensitive after a nonmetal filling. Do I need a root canal for that tooth? My dentist convinced me to replace my metal filling with a nonmetal filling.

If the X-ray shows that the filling or cavity is approximating or involving pulp, you will definitely need a root canal as just a filling will cause pain and infection in future.

{"question": "Why am I having sharp pain just left of sternum? Last night and today I have been experiencing a sharp pain just left of the sternum which is not deep, seemingly on top of the rib where it joins the sternum.

I went out in the garden today to dig a bit and wearing my HR monitor (I have got health anxiety, anxiety disorder as well as depression). As I was digging, the pain started hurting with each heartbeat. I looked at my monitor and it read 138 bpm. I am 70 years old and have been on medication (Benzodiazepines) for over 50 years for panic attacks and general anxiety. Two years ago I felt similar pain but not to this extent. I went to ER but nothing was found (the doctor said it could be costochondritis but definitely not my heart). I get bloodwork quarterly and everything was fine except cholesterol which was 235. I tried a statin but the muscle pain was too great. In my EKG I have RBBB or LAFB which 14 years back after a stress test I was told that I was probably born with it. I had gone to see the cardiologist then because of getting skipped beats and GERD he told me to ignore them. Last time I had an EKG was in the ER for six months when I had a weird pain in back and side. They checked out heart anyway and said it was fine. Probably just a colicky gallbladder. I have had stones for more than 20 years and had no surgery. So I hesitate to go to the ER again. My local doctor just closed. HR is still 88 while lying down right now.

Also, do you have any history of recent upper respiratory tract infection like a cough, rhinitis, fever, etc., if yes it points to pleuro-pericarditis which is an infection of the lining of lungs and heart which is usually viral and self-resolving? The possibility is of gastritis and reflux disease. Do you also have upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on food, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning? These are the other symptoms and may be associated. Increase in heart rate is likely due to anxiety of pain or as a reflex to pain. So, get with some more details of the symptoms as I explained above.

I suggest you take a muscle relaxant (Flexeril) and use a topical ointment with painkillers coupled with oral Ibuprofen for the pain. Local warm packs can help. A good back massage can also help to reduce the muscle spasms. Avoid doing physical activity that causes strain. Try to have a rest for a few days."}

{"question": "Is it advisable to take ayurvedic medicine for PCOD while on Eltroxin? I have hypothyroid and PCOD. I am taking Eltroxin 100 mcg. I have been put on Deviry tablets a few times to regularize periods. I am looking for a permanent cure for PCOD. I read from your posts that kalarchi choornam is effective. Can I take them along with thyroid Eltroxin tablets? Or will there be any interaction? What is your suggested treatment for my PCOD?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "You have hypothyroidism and PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease). You are not trying to get pregnant now. So, it is time to take strict Siddha medications to get a complete cure from PCOD. I advise you to continue Eltroxin tablet. During your regular visit, the physician will regulate its dose based on hormonal values. So, you no need to worry about that. In many people, Siddha drug renders the possibility of reducing Eltroxin dose. For PCOD, please follow the following medical advice. a) Kumari legium (Van kumari legium), take 2 gm (one spoon) in the morning and evening before food or Aloes compounds two tablets in the morning and two in the evening after food. b) Tablet Chithira moola kuligai one tablet in the morning and one in the night after food. c) Kalarchi chooranam 1.5 gm in the morning and evening after food with hot water or milk. If you do not get this drug in the market, you can prepare as follows: Kalarchi (Bonduc nut) seed (remove outer shell and use only the inner kernel) - 100 gm Black pepper - 10 gm Asafoetida (fried) - 10 gm, Keep these in a mixie jar and make a powder. The drug is ready. Store in a container. d) Malai vembathi thailam or Kalingaathi thailam (both or same) 5 ml daily during the night before bed. After some days, you can increase its dose a few drops. Continue all these drugs. Within three months, you will get periods. Then also during menstrual bleeding days, stop all drugs. Again, start from day fifth of the bleeding day. Continue for six months. Your uterus and ovary will become normal. Suppose, if you do not get bleeding, but only few spots, then consider it as the bleeding. If you do not get even a spot, then do not worry, you continue these drugs for six months. Tender arasam leaf (peepal tree), collect the tender leaves. Grind three leaves and mix with milk (like milkshake). Consume this in the morning. Continue this daily morning until you become normal. If you get more tender leaves at a time, dry them and powder it. Then take 1 gm and mix in milk. If you do not like milk, then use buttermilk or water. This is another important home remedy for PCOD."}

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy.

So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks.

{"question": "What causes blocked nose with hoarse voice? My family doctor referred me to an ENT to investigate a persistent sinus discharge problem that seemed to be causing voice hoarseness, likely from mucus building up in my throat. I thought the hoarseness might be a side effect of the Tamsulosin I take each day for BPH, but he did not think so. During the exam by the ENT, he found that my nostrils were almost completely blocked. Although I had not complained of problems breathing through my nose, so air could get through, his scope with the light and camera on the end could only be inserted part way through either nostril. As a result, I am being scheduled for (endoscopic?) surgery to reconstruct the separation between my nostrils and clear the airways through my nose. Apparently, it will take about 30 minutes and will not leave scars or require any packing or lengthy recovery time (just a few days). The ENT thinks that will clear up the nasal discharge and ultimately solve the hoarseness.

The radiocephalic fistula is a forearm fistula created by anastomosing the side of a radial artery to the end of a cephalic vein. It is also referred to as the Brescia-Cimino fistula. The brachiocephalic fistula is an upper arm fistula created by connecting the side of a brachial artery to the end of a cephalic vein or slightly central to the level of the elbow. Finally, the brachial artery–to–transposed basilic vein (BTB) fistula is another upper arm fistula. This fistula is created by anastomosing the side of a brachial artery to the end of a basilic vein that has been transposed laterally and elevated superficially to make it amenable to dialysis cannulation. Other sites could be leg also. I advise you to discuss it with your doctor. The patient requires dialysis for sure or you can put a central line and replace it every 15 to 20 days. But AV fistula is the best option."}

{"question": "Is there a chance to get genital herpes in patients already infected with oral herpes? I was recently diagnosed with genital herpes. I am sure I got it from a person with type 1 (had regularly cold sores in the past and probably transferred it to me through oral sex). I was wondering, is there still a chance I might infect that person genetically? Or how high is the chance? We both have the same type of herpes, but my partner only experienced oral herpes before, and I have genital herpes. Can someone who already had oral herpes develop genital herpes themselves? Or does herpes only occur at the place of infection? I want to know how high the risk is of me infecting my partner genetically (same type) when I am not showing any symptoms.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "Genital herpes can be transmitted to your partner sexually because it is an STD (sexually transmitted disease), whereas herpes simplex (HSV-1) can be transferred from one person to another via infected oral secretions while in close contact. But at times, there is a possibility of getting genital ulcers when you are infected with HSV-1. Hence, I would advise you to undergo lab test to know if you are infected with the virus or not. And if you are positive for HSV, then you will require Acyclovir, which is an antiviral medicine. Till then, I would advise you to take preventive measures to avoid transmission to other partners. If you have any further queries, feel free to contact me."}

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks.

It helps with reducing stress and anxiety and induces a sense of calmness by increasing serotonin and dopamine in the brain which are the feel-good chemicals. As such, it is a supplement and not a medicine per se, so there are no fixed guidelines issued by any regulatory authorities. Normally people do get relief with 200 to 600 mg. Since it is synthesized from a stimulant (tea) it is advised not to combine with other stimulants like caffeine. It can increase anxiety once the effect of caffeine wears off. Apart from that, there are no side effects as such and not really addictive. If the anxiety issues are troubling, it would be advisable to visit a local psychiatrist and take a short course of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) class of medicines which will help with this problem.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction.

{"question": "Do birth control pills cause nephrotic syndrome? My daughter has been taking birth control pills for five months, since she gave birth.

The nephrologist did more tests and found that she has nephrotic syndrome and is going for a kidney biopsy to see what medicine she should take to reverse the damage. I am convinced that it came from birth control pills, because it says in the side effects fluid retention in legs and feet. Has this caused any permanent damage? Is this reversible? The nephrologist said it could not come from the birth control and I disagree. I told my daughter to stop taking this pill as soon as she found out from her interest that there is protein in the urine. She has been off of it for two weeks now. My mom is a pharmacist and so I know how dangerous medicines can be and both my parents were sensitive to medicines. My daughter has a kidney biopsy scheduled for next week.

If we consider there is significant weight loss, then other specific symptoms are expected with malignancies like constipation or diarrhea, malena or symptoms pertaining to other systems if we consider issues elsewhere in the body. Also, ultrasound would have shown some mass. Although ultrasound may miss the tumor in early stages, since you are having significant weight loss and long duration of symptoms, tumor would be beyond the early stage. And the probability of malignancy is less at this age group. But we are not comfortable unless we find some alternative causes like gastric issues like chronic gastritis, diet changes, frequent indigestions, or any other changes or factors which could explain weight loss if it is significant. If there is any addiction like smoking, alcohol, or drugs it should be reduced. You may have antacids like capsule Cyra D or Pan DSR (Pantoprazole) for a few days, if you have any gastric symptoms like bloating, burping, upper abdominal pain or heartburn.

First of all, raised blood pressure in very young age, 12 years in your case, should be investigated. It must be secondary to some other disease. One of which is called pheochromocytoma. This condition causes both high BP and high pulse rate, along with sweating, fever. These symptoms are sudden and episodic. Pheochromocytoma is basically a tumor of adrenal glands. Other cause of high pulse rate may be hyperthyroidism in which thyroid gland is overfunctioning. Other symptoms include warm hands, sweaty hands, heat intolerance, weight loss despite good appetite, fine tremors, diarrhea, reduced sleep, thyroid gland may also be enlarged, some changes in eyes, etc. As you said your diet is not good, so it may have caused anemia. Anemia leads to fast heart rate. Another cause may be your sedentary lifestyle. As you said you are not active, it causes fast heart rate on slight activity. These are some non-cardiac causes of fast heart rate. Cardiac causes may be atrial fibrillation, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, etc. Detection and differentiation of these requires ECG. If one of these is diagnosed, then next step is to detect the cause of it. Then treatment is done for the cause. So, possibilities of your condition are many. There is a huge list of differentials both cardiac and non-cardiac. Proper diagnosis requires focused investigations. Please provide your previous tests (ECG, holter, etc.) so that I may devise a plan for diagnosis of your condition which may require some other tests as well. Also send a record of daily BP and pulse rate of one week at least. Remember, if pheochromocytoma is the cause, then high BP and fast pulse may be present only during episodes and normal between episodes. Beta blocker is good to control heart rate. So please follow-up with your medical record and BP, pulse rate record."}

Let me start by saying that this is not a good sign. I would have preferred to see the scan picture myself. What you are mentioning seems to be hydrops fetalis. Here water gets collected both inside and outside the body. Baby will have water collection in head, lungs, heart, abdomen, under the skin, in the fluid around the baby, even in the placenta. The causes are a long list. Some of the commoner causes are: Rh incompatibility (mother with negative blood group and baby with positive blood group), congenital heart diseases, lymphatic system abnormalities or parvovirus infection or musculoskeletal abnormalities or gastrointestinal abnormalities, the list is long. But, the net result is that fluid is not circulating in the blood, but outside. The pregnancy will have to be terminated (aborted) as baby cannot withstand this.

{"question": "Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD? I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.", "prediction": "For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help.", "reference": "I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."}

Thanks in advance.", "prediction": "I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Now I am using branded face wash and sunscreen in the morning and skin whitening cream during bedtime.", "prediction": "For further information consult a dermatologist online -->", "reference": "Microdermabrasion and chemical peel are the procedures to improve skin texture. They exfoliate the damaged superficial layer of skin, there by lightening the hyperpigmentation on the skin. This removes the dead cells in the skin, facilitating the new layer of cells to grow. After the procedure, the key is to use sunscreen round the clock, every four hours. This is because skin needs to be protected from UV rays when it is recovering. UV rays are not only from sun but also from tube lights, TV screen and computer monitor. Once applied, sunscreen protects skin for four hours, hence should be applied every four hours for optimal protection. Now talking about expectations from these cosmetic procedures. They do help to lighten the skin a bit, but, the main purpose of these procedures is to improve the texture, remove the dark pigmentation. This will take minimum four to five sittings to see improvement in skin texture provided proper after care measures are followed like protection from UV rays. I personally explain my patients that it is not skin whitening treatment, because the colour of an individual is genetically programmed. I do not want you to get disheartened. I can totally sense your concern dear, but this is the fact. You will get back your original colour after the procedure, which may be one or two shades lighter than your pre-procedure skin colour. The procedure per say can't make your skin darker, if you have used sunscreen properly as advised by your Dermatologist. Eat healthy, exercise regularly and keep your body hydrated to have a healthy skin. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"}

He has chylomicron retention disease which is not being able to absorb fat and so he needs soluble vitamins such as vitamin E and he needs a special low-fat diet. He also has developmental delays in all areas. At that time I thought it was normal because his illness was not found out until he was nearly 2 years old and had been failing to thrive before that he was under malnutrition. I also have two other boys who also have developmental delay but not as severe as how my oldest one was. Consultant are saying now that maybe some genetic issues must be going on and put us all in the 100 000 genomes study research hoping to find some answers for the abnormal blood result of my seven and a half year old. His CK levels have been persistently elevated. His last reading was 1155. AST TO 70 units per liter and ALT TO 71 units per liter. They are still investigating and hoping to find some answers. His other blood were normal for thyroid function. Glucose and lactate, ammonia in plasma, uric acid in plasma and renal functions all were fine. Due to persistent CK levels, it is pointing more towards a myopathy. I am very confused and yes, he has been showing certain signs like he cannot walk too much with feet pain, and on and off finger pains. It seems to me that he is not a strong child for his age but seems fine other than that.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "This seems to be more of a genetic disorder, unfortunately.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "Will my anxiety relapse if I stop SSRI? I am a male who was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and social anxiety, eight years back. Initially, I was prescribed Paxil 20 mg, which helped treat my anxiety and depression but I started having side effects of weight gain, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. When I stopped taking medicine, I started having anxiety and depression again. So my doctor prescribed Zoloft 50 mg and Wellbutrin XL 150 mg. After taking these pills, I started having side effects like extreme weight gain, fatigue, decrease libido, erectile dysfunction and slight hand tremors. I am worried to take a combination of two tablets for my illness because I read that taking one medicine is better than taking two. Is it true that Wellbutrin XL, when combined with SSRI, causes weight loss? And if I stop taking SSRI completely, will my anxiety relapse? I am looking for a medicine which helps my illness without causing any side effects as mentioned above.

SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) can cause significant sexual dysfunction. Usually, Bupropion along with SSRI is prescribed to reduce its sexual side effect. In your case, you are using Sertraline with Bupropion, and you are reporting no improvement in weight gain or sexual function, it is not that common to gain weight with Sertraline, but it can happen. Buproprion traditionally is an activating drug, and it is useful for reducing weight and improving sexual functions. I suggest you try taking Escitalopram 10 mg and Buspirone 15 mg (7.5 mg twice daily). Escitalopram is a classic SSRI, which has a minimal side effect of weight gain and sexual dysfunction. I know you do not want to take multiple medicines, but it is a much better approach to handling your illness. I would suggest you start this combination of drugs immediately after consulting your specialist, as some people are more sensitive to the adverse effects of the drug, so we may have to explore multiple options before we find the right combination for you.

{"question": "My child's WBC count remains high even under antibiotics. What is wrong with him? My 4 year son is ill for past two weeks.

For the first two weeks, I could barely drink room temperature drinks without being in agony. I made an appointment after two weeks to have my dentist look at it to make sure it was not cracked or anything. He never even looked at it, he gave me an antibiotic and said if it did not get any better, I would need a root canal. A few days later the sensitivity went away and I thought it healed. Last week, I noticed the gums above it have changed color. They are a slight red, purple and the gum itself is very sensitive. Under my nose and some of my cheek, I can feel where it is swollen (the gum). It also throbs sometimes.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

What could it be? My pregnancy test came back negative.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "I have read your concern. It is good you have already ruled out pregnancy because, in any type of abnormal bleeding among reproductive age, pregnancy is one of the first condition that should be ruled out. The second most common cause of these types of bleeding is a hormonal imbalance. Theoretically, your progesterone hormone should be elevated on the second half of your cycle and decreases when you are nearing the start of your period. So the amount of this hormone is critical in making you bleed. If there is too slow of a decrease or too abrupt or most the time insufficient amount, then it will affect the timing of the bleeding and will cause heavy bleeding. The treatment for this is oral Progesterone or in the form of birth control pills. The third common cause would be a structural problem, the presence of a polyp, myoma or endometrial lining problem, infection, etc. These situations will need ultrasound and evaluation by an ob-gyn. For your case, I suggest you take first Ibuprofen thrice a day for the first 3 to 4 days of your period. This would help in decreasing the bleeding and at the same time avoid pain. You may opt to observe this cycle of bleeding for another month or it would be more helpful to have a scheduled appointment with your ob-gyn for the next month."}

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

So, during the process of collection of semen, you may create situations where you accidentally contaminate your sample from your own source, that is, your body with the not so harmful organisms living on your skin. I think you can repeat the test and along with that, you do a routine checking of your semen, that is, semen analysis so that you can be assured that your semen contains an adequate number of viable sperms. You did not mention your marital status or having any child. I guess you are little worried about the change of color of your semen. I suggest you follow the proper steps before collecting semen for culture and analysis and then if it is proved that your semen sample is not contaminated, then we can suggest an antibiotic.

{"question": "Can vitamin B12 deficiency result in unbalancing while walking? Three years back, I had the problem of unbalancing while walking. I never felt any dizziness or spinning of head. I just had a feeling that I will fall down. I consulted a doctor and he told me that it was due to vitamin B12 deficiency and also prescribed me few shots of Vitcofol. Initially, I felt a lot better after taking them and I took them for one year at reducing frequency. Though I was not completely out of the problem, doctor asked me to stop taking those shots. Now, the same problem has got back after a gap of three years. But now along with problem of unbalancing I am having weakness, palpitation and uneasiness in stomach as well as having sore mouth. Four months back, I have consulted a cardiologist. He ran few tests such as ECG, echo and TMT. My heartbeat was low at 48 bpm. No problem was detected in angiogram and no blockage was present. Doctor suggested me Orcibest 10 and Tonact ASP for low pulse rate. I was referred to a neurologist. He carried out MRI of brain and spinal cord. No abnormality was detected in either of them. My vitamin B12 was found to be 507 pg/ml. Based on my history three years back; doctor gave me vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamine) shots in spite of the vitamin B12 level being normal. After taking them I am comparatively feeling better and there is improvement in my walking. There is no uneasiness in heart as well in stomach; sore mouth has all improved drastically. After ten weekly shots and doctor reduced the frequency to one per month. But after a couple of weeks again I began to feel weak. A month back, the doctor again put me back on weekly shots of vitamin B12. My present condition is that, my energy level has improved but only slightly. The problem of unbalancing has improved but still far from normal. With shoes on, I find it very difficult to walk. With sandals and slippers I feel little easier to walk. I am still taking vitamin B12 shots. For low pulse rate, I am taking Orcibest 10 and Tonact ASP as prescribed by the cardiologist. For hypertension, I am taking Amlodac 2.5. Along with all these, I am taking vitamin E orally. I would like to have your opinion whether my treatment is on the right line or is there any other issue which is causing this problem.

{"question": "I experience intense pain during sex. Please advise on the problem. I need some advice on an ongoing problem that has my doctor stumped. I am experiencing intense pain during sex, to the point that it often entirely prevents intimacy. This has been going on for about 12 months. The pain is consistently in the same spot, just behind my hymen to the right. It is not cervical or abdominal, does not shift, and is not linked to any vaginal contraction. It is worst immediately upon penetration. I am a lady with a very high pain tolerance, but initial penetration has me screaming/throwing my partner off me at the moment. If I am able to battle through the first minute or two, it starts easing. I am not generally intensely sore (beyond the usual little ache) after sex, and the whatever-it-is does not usually make itself known outside of sex (even when I sit down hard/use the bathroom), although there have been perhaps four to five little twinges over the past 12 months when I have been walking around. I have had two doctor's appointments about this previously. On the first, I went through full STD testing to eliminate a disease or infection, but all tests came back clear, including BV. On the second appointment, I went in for a pap-smear and visual inspection of the spot. Pap smear was negative, and the doctor was only able to say that she could see a 'pink irritated area' in the location. I described the pain as being centered - no cysts/polyps/tumors/notable textural difference/cuts/scarring/injury to my hymen. I am self-lubricating relatively normally and using lubricant when I do not. I am not experiencing any contractions upon penetration. The painful spot is consistent whether I am with a partner/using a sexual aid/touching it with my fingers. It does seem to ease somewhat when it has been seven or more days since I have had a sexual encounter, but every time after the first time following a break it is as painful as ever.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "What you seem to be suffering is from vaginismus where the pain is related only to the initial penetration and not due to any organic cause. The cause of vaginismus is either the vaginal muscles are too taut, or you are not sexually excited enough before the act. And also, the vaginal opening may be slightly small. So, I suggest using alternatives to widen the opening before penetration is practiced. This problem generally goes away after delivery when the vagina is stretched. So, the same can be mechanically applied in privacy and am sure you would be benefitted. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"}

Do not be afraid of thoughts of failure in the exam, if not succeded in this year, do more hard effort again. Have faith in God, everything will be fine.

{"question": "Can I take Betnelan tablet and Mosegor syrup to stay healthy and gain weight? I am using Betnelan tablet and Mosegor syrup to stay healthy. Is it advisable to take it? I am using it for the past one year. Please advise.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I would not suggest you use them. These tablets and syrup are not going to help you to gain weight or muscle building. Betnelan is steroids and it will cause harm to your body in the long run. Steroid work by replacing the testosterone hormone that would normally be produced by the body. Suppression of natural hormones made in the body is the most common side effect of steroid use. Eventually, the body can no longer produce the necessary amounts of testosterone, leaving the body out of its equilibrium state. Long term use of steroid lower body's immunity and lead to infection and other diseases in your body. In order to build muscle and body there is no better way than joining a gym and supplementing it with a diet rich in proteins. Choose high calorific foods like milkshakes, fruits like banana, pineapple, chiku, pear, and dry fruits. Add more protein like peanut, soyabean, pulses, and meat in your diet. Egg and milk are wholesome food. Take them daily. Warm milk before going to bed brings in a healthy and considerable weight gain. Start with smaller proportions initially and gradually increase the intake. It is important to have a balance between exercise and diet for a healthy weight gain."}

So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

This nicotine is absorbed through buccal mucosa thus not allowing the withdrawal symptoms to become evident, but the benefit is that you are free from most of the side effects of smoking per se, especially the smoke entering into lungs which may lead to lung diseases in future. This is a substitute to nicotine supplementation and is being prescribed for chronic smokers who wish to discontinue it slowly by following the principle of slow desensitization. These are available off the counter and no prescription is required for the same. You may try it and try to reduce your smoking urges. In the end, Nicotex can just help you in a way but you need to develop a will to quit smoking and that is very important. You may try and see how you respond to it as every person responds differently to its use. It has been seen to give successful outcomes, but again will power is still the most important thing behind quitting smoking."}

Main symptoms are currently upper abdominal pain with frequent indigestion when fatty, oily, or fried food is consumed. Particularly, issues with nuts and dairy products. I previously had IBS like symptoms and was also diagnosed with H. Pylori and stones in the gallbladder a couple of years back, although it was told that the stones were small in size. Please check the attached image for detailed symptoms by period and results of blood tests. I have also been requested for an ultrasound of the abdomen. What bothers me is the referral to a hematologist. Can you please suggest?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I have gone through the attachments (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Probable cause is cholecystitis. After reviewing your records, it is noticeable that there is persistent leukocytosis with prevailing neutrophilia and a slight microcytosis that is low MCV (mean corpuscular volume) and hypochromia that is low MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin) of RBC (red blood cells). Since your ferritin level is normal and no abnormal hemoglobin was detected, it is safe to rule out the presence of both iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia which makes the aforementioned constellation indicative probably of a chronic infection which may cause an impaired iron turnover as evident from the persistently low MCV and MCH. Now, your primary complaint is abdominal pain, which obviously is a chronic one since it spans around two years. Yet, you do not state whether it is in the left or right abdominal half. The presence of gallbladder stones can cause chronic inflammation of the gallbladder and that condition can cause all related lab abnormalities. You have elevated cholesterol levels and TGL (triglycerides) as well as a BMI (body mass index) which is considered obese. It is highly probable that the reason for these gallstones is the increased concentration of cholesterol in bile. It is advisable to repeat the USG (ultrasound) of gallstones that might have increased. You should be offered a treatment regimen to \"dissolve\" the gallstones starting with the diet such as low fat/cholesterol food, intake of more vegetables and vegetable oil, also increased physical activity; secondarily, if necessary drug treatment or surgery. USG will also yield information regarding your liver and spleen, which is important if one is to suspect a hematologic disorder. In my opinion, there is less reason to suspect a hematological disorder in your case. If such is to be considered, then given the protracted course of two years, this should be either chronic myeloproliferative disorder (such as chronic myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis) of lymphoproliferative disorder (such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Both are diseases of the elderly, then splenomegaly should usually be present. And you should have other symptoms such as nights sweats, weight loss more than 10% for less than six months, malaise, fever. A simple differential blood count could reveal whether that neutrophilia is due to the presence of segmented cells only, meaning - infection or due to the presence of expanded WBC formula that could prompt further testing. As for the lymphocytes, yes, they are elevated, but their number is fluctuating paralleling and inflammatory state. In case there is spleen enlargement on USG and you have enlarged lymph nodes, then further testing may be necessary to rule out chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It is okay to be seen by a hematologist, who can review the differential manually and examine for the presence of enlarged spleen or liver and then consider whether further and more sophisticated testing is warranted. But most probably your complaints are due to the presence of chronic gallbladder inflammation. As for the H. pylori (Helicobacter pylori), a more informative test is the stool antigen test. Serology for H. Pylori is often falsely positive, but the antigen test before and after the double antibiotic course is much more informative. I would advise you to go through with a gastroenterologist once again and in alkaline phosphatase is present to monitor the WBC parameters with its resolution upon appropriate treatment. Investigations to be done include abdominal ultrasound, GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) and ALP (alkaline phosphatase). For more information consult a hematologist online -->"}

If you start full correct glasses at a very young age hopefully before 10, then there is a chance of reversing but after 17 years it will not correct and it is not possible to do anything. At your age, we have to consider keratoconus where your cornea is getting weaker, making it protrude like a cone. Usually, there it is present as a frequent need to change spectacles. There we need to see a map in your cornea with its thickness which is called a topography. And further, we need to see the back of your eyes to see your retina and optic nerve. I suggest you consult an eye doctor not a family doctor to sort this out for you. You need to be physically checked with an instrument called a slit lamp with lenses and sometimes may need investigations. For more information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online -->"}
{"question": "Why am I having sharp pain in left lower abdomen? I am 31 years old female, 5'8\", 175 lbs. Three days ago I started getting a really sharp pain in the lower left abdomen. It came on sudden and was gone within seconds but still bad enough to have me doubled over in pain. Thought it was related to period that was due following day. Happened on and off all day.Next day period did start as expected. Normal flow, normal cramps, etc. Then the sharp stabbing pain came back. It is stabbing in a very precise location, down and to the left from the belly button, kind of in-line with the hip. It was radiating hellfire to my low back, groin, thigh, hip, and left flank. I was on the floor in pain for four hours before it faded away enough for me to even stand. That night it happened again waking me from sleep. Lasted for hours, stabbing in the same spot, burning pain spread to the other areas. Later that day my toddler laid across me and his elbow got that same spot and started the pain up all over again but it only lasted about an hour. The area is very tender. I still get the brief stabbing pain when walking or coughing or bending over. I am thinking it is a ruptured cyst. I have never been diagnosed with one before but I think it fits the bill. But can they rupture multiple times within days? Is it likely to happen again? Could it be something related to period or just coincidence it started at the same time? What can I do at home for it, since I am unable to go in to see a doctor?", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "I went through your complain which I must say you have very nicely written down. As per the location of the pain that you mentioned, there are some conditions that need to be ruled out. First is appendicitis. It is followed by vomiting and constipation. Second is renal calculi or stones. This pain comes from behind while passing urine. Third, as you mentioned ovarian cyst but the ruptured cyst is a medical emergency and is unlikely. Get an abdomen and renal ultrasound is done to get a proper diagnosis. If you can, then do it after your periods."}
{"question": "An 8-year-old is having negative behavior at home. Please help.

Is her behaviour the same everywhere? What do the teachers say? Does she interact well with her friends? It will help to know whether her behavioral issues are limited to home or present at school as well? A detailed assessment including developmental history will be needed to formulate the reasons behind her behavior. It needs to be clarified whether this is a behavioral issue or whether there is an underlying emotional problem manifesting as oppositional behavior. Discuss with her school teacher first. Explore whether she can see a psychologist based at school, if available. If problems are significant and persistent, it is advisable to consult a child psychologist or child psychiatrist near your place for a comprehensive assessment and manage accordingly. Continue with clear and consistent boundaries. Parenting in this situation can be difficult and exhausting but consistency is the key. Get support from your partner, grandparents as applicable. Most children eventually learn to adhere to parental rules and boundaries. Getting appropriate support will help to make the situation better. Take care."}

But the details are a little confusing, it would have been good if you could give details with dates when beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) was checked. I understand that scans were performed and the beta hCG test on 8th May is 178 and on 10th May it was 247. On 13th May you got the scan as you had a spotting, right? See, as your previous cycles have been irregular, it is difficult to predict when you would have ovulated exactly. So we cannot go by your dates to calculate the duration of the pregnancy. May I know when did the urine pregnancy test turn positive for the first time? It would be advisable to recheck your urine pregnancy test now again, as you had spotting, if the levels are falling then it would be suggestive of a miscarriage, and mostly this could be like a biochemical pregnancy, where pregnancy is detected only in the blood tests, but on the scan I cannot find the gestational sac development, which has ultimately got aborted. (As levels you mentioned last were pretty low). Another possibility to be ruled out, more importantly, is ectopic pregnancy or pregnancy at some unknown location. To rule out all these, doing a serum beta hCG will clear your doubts. Serum beta hCG level. Repeat ultrasound after checking the beta hCG value. Report to your gynecologist if you have any sharp pain."}

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

A sebaceous gland is a microscopic gland in the skin which secretes a waxy liquid known as sebum. It opens on the skin via an opening known as a punctum. When the opening gets blocked, the sebum collected in the gland causes a swelling known as a cyst. It hardens over time to become firm. They are quite common in the genital region. The diagnostic sign of sebaceous cyst is that it slips beneath the fingers and it mostly has an opening. In your case, they cause pain because the skin there gets stretched during an erection. If it causes pain all the time, it could be infected and might need local application of an antibiotic ointment like T-Bact (Mupirocin) or Neosporin (combination of Neomycin, Polymyxin B and Bacitracin) twice a day. You also need to keep the area clean and dry. They are benign and harmless and nothing to worry about. It could have been easier to confirm if you had sent a picture along.

But when you say cervix is outside the vagina, it means cervical descent or elongation. It could mean a nulliparous prolapse. The best method would be to have an examination done, scan taken, to know if any large cyst is pushing uterus out. If everything is normal, you can have 3 to 4 doses of monthly Lupreolide 3.75 mg i.m. Followed by tablet Ormeloxifene 60 mg weekly twice for any number of years. I have found it more effective than Dienogest. If prolapse is significant, it may resolve if any cyst of pressure from inside is relieved.

I hope you are not having dark colored stools or nose bleeds or blood in cough of vomiting or any small injury taking more time for the blood to stop. If any of these condition persists you need to see an emergency service and get you your blood coagulation profile done. Skin is dry in your condition, use emollients do not use harsh cleansing soaps. Use only mild ones that too on alternate days.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

{"question": "Can essential tremor get transferred genetically? The person I am taking about is having severe tremors in the hand and fingers while going to new places. So, the person avoids huge crowd and sound. The person is 30 now and said that the problem was there from his childhood. All of the siblings have this tremor in the hand and finger. If the men or women from the affected family marry the person outside the family, then does it come to the child? Is this type of tremor curable? Women in the family are not able to hold the lid of the pressure cooker and cut vegetables. Men in the family are not able to hold the tea cup that means hands are shaking and not able to dial a number in a mobile phone without shaking. They underwent test before 10 years and was diagnosed to have essential tremor. Now, I want to know the answers to the following questions. What is the further impact and symptoms of essential tremor over a period of time if left untreated? How does it affect the daily activities? Is it genetically transferable to the next generation? Do we have any permanent cure for essential tremor? If the person has essential tremor, then what are the chances of linkage to other illnesses and disorders?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I have read your question with care and understand your doubts regarding essential tremors. If not treated, the person will not be able to do or will do with much difficulty works involving fingers like writing, mixing food, button shirts, etc. Activities which require co-ordinated movements of the fingers will be affected. Essential tremors can be due to various reasons and a few of these reasons are transmitted genetically. A few are acquired. Even among the ones which are transmitted genetically, it can be AD, AR, XD, XR that is autosomal dominant, autosomal resistant, X-linked dominant and X-linked resistant respectively. So, unless we know the exact cause of this tremor, we cannot answer about genetic transmission. Without knowing the exact cause, the answer for this question is 0 to 100 (0 for acquired and 100 for AD). The cure of essential tremor depends on the cause. A few causes can be cured completely, a few causes can be controlled and a few cannot be cured at all. Again, the link with other illness and disorders depends on the cause of the tremor. Coming to this particular patient, who has this when going to new places or during anxiety, this tremors can be controlled with proper medication.

Do meditation for 20 minutes daily. 3. Eat healthy home cooked foods, avoid junk foods. 4. Spend quality time with friends and family daily. 5.

The dose is lower than that when you are being treated for deep vein thrombosis. There are other anticoagulants which can be used but Xarelto is preferred.

The next thing is, you should undergo a treadmill test. If it is negative, then it reliably rules out the cardiac cause. For hyperlipidemia, you should be on aggressive lifestyle modification by taking low fat, oily and sweet diet. Do regular exercise every day and avoid drinking alcohol. Also, get your blood pressure checked once.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

According to your weight and height your BMI is 35, which falls in borderline to moderately to severely obese. I advise you to visit or ask an endocrinologist regarding the shrinking of the testicles and erectile issues as these may be related to hormonal balance or even obesity. Red circles on the inner thighs (attachment removed to protect patient identity) are indicative of fungal infection known as tinea cruris. For this, a course of antifungals is advised. I would suggest the following treatment. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. The outgrowths of skin are skin tags and they are usually related to hyperlipidemia. They are not harmful and only have cosmetic concerns. They are best dealt with by simple office based surgery with cautery machine requiring only local anesthesia, which is a 5 minute superficial procedure. But, they will not go on their own. You may get your fasting serum lipid profile done, which will measure the levels of cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein), VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein). If any of these are abnormal suitable, then medicine can be started. Medicine is important as abnormal lipid profile increases one's risk of cardiac events in the future. One important thing on which I cannot emphasize enough would be decreasing your weight. If you can gradually decrease your weight even by a few pounds, you would see a lot of these medical problems would get better by themselves. You may follow up after two to three weeks.

I rinsed my mouth, but only about 30 minutes after licking the nail polish remover. I brushed twice, and since then I have had dinner and brushed again, but my mouth still has that weird taste. Do I need to worry about poisoning due to licking the nail polish remover or is there no reason to worry?", "prediction": "For further information consult a dermatologist online -->", "reference": "If you have any further queries please ask me.

What to do?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I understand your concern. Did all these problems start after break up? If it is so, this is commonly called as an adjustment disorder. If severe it could lead to depression too. My advice will be to first understand that you are experiencing this problem and it is due to certain chemical changes probably triggered by stress. Your change in behavior may be the result of this. Try to distract yourself from situations which make you upset and keep yourself engaged. Try to plan a new resolution and work towards it. Try daily exercises or yoga. Try meeting new friends and take a break from your schedule. Try out doing something which you always wanted but never did in the past. The symptoms you are experiencing is temporary and it will pass. If nothing is helping you and you are experiencing low mood, sleep disturbances, etc., then a small dose of antidepressants like Escitalopram at around 10 mg dose will help you a lot."}
{"question": "What is the reason for shoulder and arm pain? My wife is 28 years old. She is suffering from shoulder and arm pain. She has more pain during night-time and not able to get good sleep. First we consulted a doctor; he gave some multivitamin and Calcium tablets. Also advised her to do some exercise, but there is no effect. Then we consulted another doctor and he advised for a blood test. The result came back as hemoglobin 10.5 and serum uric acid 5.98. I have attached the medical prescription given by then for 20 days.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "How to prevent frequent episodes of tonsillitis? I am suffering with tonsillitis for past three years. Nearly four months back, my tonsils got swollen. Followed by that the right tonsil remains the same and the left got subsided. In these four months, I had few episodes of pain in my ear. Also the glands in my right side of neck got swollen. I had Azithromycin, Erythromycin, Penicillin and Clavamax but the swelling of the tonsil and the glands did not go down? What should I do to prevent further episode? Does the cold temperature affect the tonsils?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "With the conversation we had, I understand that you are an 18 year old male suffering from tonsillitis and you have been having acute exacerbation of the tonsillitis now. Due to the infection, you suffer from ear pain and swollen neck glands. You seem to be suffering from chronic tonsillitis. This resulted in episodes once a while leading to throat pain, difficulty in swallowing, ear ache, neck swelling, fever, etc. Tonsils are lymphoid organs which act as portals to remove offending agents like bacteria. However, in some individuals they themselves become the cause of infection. Infection from enlarged tonsils can spread to nose, ear or further down as throat infection which will cause great discomfort to the patients. Also, because of the same patient suffers from loss of days at work place or school or college. For your condition, I would suggest you to go ahead with tonsillectomy operation. This operation removes both the tonsils. It is done under general anesthesia and is done through the mouth. There will not be any incision outside. The reasons why I suggest you to go for the tonsillectomy operation are that, Few episodes of tonsillitis in a year can be successfully managed using medicines. However, in your case tonsillectomy operation is ideal as I explained above. In the meantime till we decide for surgery, please follow the instructions and suggestions I have given below. Some precautions to be taken are, It is true that cold climate can result in increased susceptibility to tonsillitis. Cold winds accompanied by consumption of road side or outside food can increase the chance of infection. Always use boiled water and desist from drinking water from local places. When tonsils are enlarged, the infection can move through the eustachian tube into the ear, complicate the condition and cause decreased hearing or ear discharge. Sometime the tonsils can cause referred pain to the ear though the infection may be restricted to throat. Lymph fluid from tonsils drains into neck nodes, more particularly the jugulodigastric node below the angle of jaw. Hence, the tonsillar infection will also infect the node and cause neck swelling. The swelling will resolve once the tonsillitis is cured. If the symptoms do not recede then please do the following tests. 1. Complete blood count including but not restricted to ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), platelet and lymphocytes. 2. Absolute eosinophil count. 3. Throat swab for culture and sensitivity. 1. Tonsillolith. 2. Acute Follicular Tonsillitis. 3. Acute Parenchymatous Tonsillitis. Acute exacerbation of chronic tonsillitis. I suggest you the following medications; however a complete and thorough physical examination is required to make a definitive diagnosis and prescribe the apt medication. 1. Take a stronger antibiotic, like Cefixime 200 mg, twice a day for 5 days. 2. Take an antibiotic that against anaerobic organisms, like Tinidazole or Ornidazole for 3 days after consulting with your doctor. 3. Take anti-inflammatory enzymes like trypsin-chymotrypsin tablet before food daily thrice for 2 days (Chymoral forte). 4. Take pain killers if necessary (Paracetamol 650 mg twice a day). 5. Hot salt water gargling daily three to four times and steam inhalation. 6. Follow the general instructions and precautions explained above. If the treatment does not help, you may need hospitalization and intravenous administration of medicines. Also a throat swab is necessary in such cases to ascertain if any dangerous strain of bacteria has caused the infection. For further information consult an ENT otolaryngologist online.--->"}
{"question": "I stopped Prevacid due to the risk of dementia. Is the damage already done reversible? I am a 49-year-old male. I took Prevacid for 17 years. One or two pills a day. I stopped five months ago after I read about that it increases the risk of dementia. If I do not have dementia now, and I have stopped the medication do my risks of dementia remain elevated for the rest of my life? Is the effect reversible? Does stopping the medication mean I am no longer at higher risk for dementia? Is the damage already done even if it is not noticeable at present? I asked my GP, and she said nobody knows. That even if I took an extensive test from a neuropsychologist, it would only mean I do not have dementia today, but it does not mean that my past Prevacid use would not cause dementia in the future. That leaves a life of uncertainty ahead. Is that the answer we just do not know? I wanted to ask a neurologist before I accept that answer.", "prediction": "For further information consult a neurologist online -->", "reference": "After careful review, I understand you are worried about the side effects of Lansoprazole (Prevacid). Now as you have stopped taking it, the risk of side effects do not remain the same as with taking the drug. The reversibility of effects is based on the extent and the nature of damages done by any drug. For example, if a drug causes scarring (fibrosis) of the liver tissues, it usually does not come back and is an irreversible side effect. Dementia does not come so early and usually decades are needed for its development and not every patient on Lansoprazole ends up with dementia. To give you good news, the link between dementia and Lanoprazole is not certain. It is still under research and is not an established fact as of today. Also, we have to see that Lansoprazole prevents the patient from serious bleeding and ulcers of the stomach. So it outweighs the risks of dementia if any. For better understanding, you have the option to consult a neurologist. He will be able to articulate this fact in a better way based on your clinical evaluation. Yes, your GP is right in saying that. But based on the facts in pharmacological post-marketing research, there are the least chances, if any of dementia. I hope this helps."}

Your blood picture shows that the iron which is absorbed is not being utilized properly. Your transferrin saturation levels 56 % is high but not more than 62 %, which is indicative of homozygosity for the HFE gene. Moreover, genetic testing is confirmatory. Fasting transferrin saturation values in excess of 45 % for males or 35 % in premenopausal women (i.e. 300 ng/L in males and 200 ng/L in females) are recognized as a threshold for further evaluation of hemochromatosis. You have already been diagnosed as heterozygous for hereditary hemochromatosis, and these values are to be expected. Since your serum ferritin levels are towards the lower end of the normal range, you do not need to undergo phlebotomy. Serum ferritin in excess of 1000 nanograms per milliliter of blood is almost always attributable to hemochromatosis. The increase in RBC count and hemoglobin is a direct result of the testosterone therapy you are receiving. I would say that currently you need not worry but you need to keep monitoring your serum ferritin level and transferrin saturation in order to prevent the development of complications and receive adequate treatment when your iron stores reach levels that can cause them.

According to your history, he is very symptomatic and needs draining of fluid frequently to relieve dyspnea. Also, your doctor has rightly said that we must do a biopsy of the lump, to find out the exact type of cancer to start appropriate chemotherapy or radiotherapy as per the report. It is not necessary to do surgery all the time. But if he is having a recurrent collection of pleural fluid, then he might need a procedure called Pleurodesis to close the space around the lungs to prevent the recurrent filling of fluid. So it is up to the wish of the patient and relatives to start chemotherapy or not after the diagnosis of cancer is done. Otherwise, you can continue with only symptomatic (palliative) treatment and frequent tapping of fluid to relieve dyspnea. I hope this helps."}
{"question": "Why do periods get delayed after first time sex? I had sex for the first time. After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist.

{"question": "I found two genital warts inside the vagina. Is it due to HPV? I am a 19-year-old female. I lost my virginity about 10 months ago with my boyfriend. Now after 10 months has passed I found out that I have two warts inside my vagina. It is white color although, the one on the top started to have a slight pink color. But the second one on the bottom which is much smaller still has completely white color and around the vagina blades, I have a little while dots. Also, there are very tiny warts line along the blades. So, when I went to see the GP near my house he had a look and said that there is nothing to worry it is still small. But in my opinion, I think it is quite big. So the doctor gave me a prescription for Condyline paint which he told me to use for three days only per week and I have to keep using it for three weeks and if it does not get better he told me to see him again. Now I have a few questions. Is this mean I have an HPV virus inside my body? How can I make the virus go away permanently? Will Gardasil injection make it go away? If it does not go away permanently, how can I make sure that I have no HPV viruses and so these warts will not come back again? Is this mean that I have this HPV from my boyfriend? How to use Condyline paint correctly? I wash my vagina blades and use the cotton pads to dry it, then I use start to use the Condyline paint. I only dip the swab once into the reagent and then I open my vagina blades so that I am able to paint the two warts inside my vagina as much as I can. Then I paint it all over the very tiny warts in the vagina blades area. Am I doing it correctly? Now I have been using the Condyline for two days, but the very tiny warts that are around the vagina blades started to grow more. Is this mean anything? Can condoms prevent these HPV viruses? If I break up with my boyfriend, will this help my symptoms and health to become better? I am very scared of whether this can leads to cancer? I do not want this to ever happen to me again, how can I prevent this to happen again? If my warts are gone can I have sex with my boyfriend? Will these symptoms comeback again? If I decided to buy the Gardasil injection and injected it now, then the next after two months, then next after six months, but during this time can I have sex with my boy friend? Will the vaccine still work?", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "I have gone through your history and pictures provided. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I appreciate that you have consulted the doctor and begun the treatment. As rightly prescribed, Condyline (Podophyllotoxin) paint is very effective in genital warts. The right way of application is by using a cotton swab or brush applicator on the clean and dry visible warts. Wait till the paint dries before putting on garments. Avoid application to surrounding normal skin. Repeat application two to three times a week until there is a substantial shrink in size or disappearance of warts. Genital warts that you have acquired are because of humanpapilloma virus (HPV) infection which you might have got through sexual route. Most of the times even if one has an HPV infection, it will be subclinical. The infected person not necessarily will have warts but may still continue to shed infective virus in secretions. Once infected with HPV, its elimination is not completely possible nor its elimination is measurable. However, you can prevent symptoms of HPV infection by boosting immunity against it. Gardasil is one of the vaccines against HPV types. This is most effective in preventing cervical cancer when taken before the start of sexual activity and before 26 years of age. However, you can still take the vaccine as the strains that cause warts and that may cause cancer are not the same. Thus Gardasil can still provide immunity to a certain extent against cancer causing HPV. The best way to monitor cervical cancer is to get regular cervical smears. HPV can be present in normal looking skin too. So, the disappearance of warts does not mean free from infection. It is important to use barrier methods like condoms during intercourse to prevent re-infection and further spread. Since the warts are intravaginal, some lesions may not be visible to you. It is better you take doctor's help to apply on all visible warts. If your partner also has HPV infection, the chances that warts will reoccur or spread are more. I recommend a dermatological examination for your partner also. And it is advisable to maintain abstinence during the treatment and vaccine period to help achieve good immunity. After the successful treatment of genital warts and vaccination, sexual activity can be resumed. However, the use of barrier methods during intercourse is advantageous in preventing re-infection. Having one sexually transmitted infection predisposes one to acquire another. UTI (urinary tract infection) could be one of the symptoms. I recommend both partners to have a thorough check with the STD (sexually transmitted disease) expert for early intervention if required."}

You might have bleeding as a side effect of Nuvaring or there could be other possibilities as well. Cervical pathology like dysplasia, erosion, cervical or endometrial polyp, any local inflammatory lesion, pelvic infection, or hormonal effects. It is better to have one high vaginal swab as well to exclude any pelvic pathology. Collect HVS and smear reports and discuss here or with your gynecologist. This brown discharge shows old clotted blood around NuvaRing. Oral contraceptive itself has side effects of irregular bleeding.

{"question": "Does excess clearing of throat cause blood in sputum? I had pneumonia two years ago and I have recovered from it after taking antibiotics for 10 days.

But I feel the need of clearing my throat quite often. I have good energy and I take vitamins during the day. Could vitamin B12, D complex, vitamin C, NAC and Omega 3 influence my situation?

{"question": "Tinnitus worsening mom's anxiety. What might help her? My mother is in a care home and is experiencing very loud tinnitus. She is becoming very stressed and anxious as this has been going on for months. We have asked her GP to help but it does not seem that anything can be done. She has had her ears cleared but this has not helped either. She is 89, on beta blockers, and recently prescribed a water tablet in place of a blood pressure tablet that is known to cause tinnitus but the problem is still ongoing. My question is, would it be advisable to ask for something like Propranolol or similar to be prescribed as she is very distressed? Do you think this would help to keep her calm and perhaps help with tinnitus which I am sure is made worse by her anxious state? She is very deaf now and finds it difficult to wear her hearing aids as she has a perforated ear. Can you help as this is very distressing to see her in this state?

{"question": "What is the difference between spine fusion and fixation surgery? What is the difference between spine fusion and fixation surgery?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "The spine fusion means we fuse one mobile segment of the spine. That means we fuse between two vertebral bodies. We put bone graft there and it fuses with time. This is usually done if there is instability at that segment or spinal canal is so narrow that while decompression we are sure that this segment will become unstable. We also put screws because it takes around six months to fuse, till that time those screws will prevent instability at that segment. In spinal fixation surgery, we only put screws and connect them with rods. This is done mainly in trauma cases where natural healing occurs with time and till that time screws are kept in place.

So it is very important to find out the particular trigger in our surroundings and avoid outside pollution as much as possible.

I remember being a kid and trying to play flute and trembling like crazy. My thyroid, calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, copper, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, GGT, CK, etc., are all normal. I got an ECG done a year back, and the reports said derivations in the muscles deltoid, biceps, common extensor of the fingers, and first inter-bone dorsal shows no signs of neurogenic or myogenic atrophy. My tremors get worse after exercise, and they are horrible when I am nervous. If I am opening a heavy door, the arm shakes, if I am doing push-ups or planks, my whole body trembles like crazy. If I need to push a little harder on the syringe while injection, the tremor starts. When I draw a medicine from a vial before administrating, I have to close my arms to elbows, so I do not tremble. I do not smoke and drink, not even coffee or tea and eat the best I can. I am only taking Finasteride and topical Minoxidil for male hair loss from 10 years. I am very sad because it is getting difficult to perform my job and no one in my family understands. I never missed one day in work, I have passed through three neurologists. The first diagnosed it as essential tremor, and asked me to take Primidone, it was horrible and I had to quit. The second said that it was an exacerbated physiologic tremor, and the prescription was Rivotril (Clonazepam). This diagnosis made me sad, as my family said over and over that it was all stress. Rivotril did calm me, but the tremor went on, so I quit it. The last neurologist after getting the electromyography said it was an essential tremor. I am confused now, as my mom trembles from hand but only when she is stressed. This tremor is not here all the time. When I hold my arm on a table and get down to get something, my arm trembles instantly. My writing is fine, and I only have asthma, male alopecia, and a history of septoplasty.

The most common type of abnormal heart rhythm at your age (assuming you do not have any pre-existing heart conditions) is supraventricular tachycardia. This can produce symptoms like palpitations, lightheadedness, and a strange feeling in the chest. An ECG, if done during the actual episode, can provide a diagnosis. But at least, you should get a baseline ECG. So, I suggest seeing your general physician within the next few days. Other things that are pertinent when you have fast heart rhythms are: 1. Excess production of thyroid hormone (a thyroid test TSH would be appropriate).2. Excessive consumption of caffeine.3. Any recreational drug use like cocaine.4. Electrolyte imbalance.If you get these episodes frequently, you should see a cardiologist who can order some tests."}
{"question": "There is no improvement with tinnitus post surgery. Why? I am a 33 year old male. Two years back I had severe running nose and could not breathe through nose, especially during the night. Then, I was diagnosed with antrochoanal polyp in my right nose.

Over last 15 days I feel ringing in my right ear, so I got shocked and got my right nose FESS surgery done.

{"question": "What is the significance of a fluctuating blood pressure? My father has been suffering from hypertension for more than 12 years and has been taking medication. For the past six to seven months, his blood pressure has been very much under control with Ayurvedic treatment. So, he very gradually decreased and stopped taking the medicines. Around four to five weeks back, his blood pressure started rising again. So, he re-started some medications after consultation with the doctor. Now, we are seeing fluctuations in his daily blood pressure varying from (systolic readings) 115 - 170 during a day (his systolic blood pressure reading even dropped to 95 after taking one of the tablets - Prazopress, after which doctor asked to take that specific tablet - Prazopress on requirement basis). We have had all the relevant tests, which look fine as per our doctor, except for high cholesterol and Vitamin-D deficiency. He is currently taking Nebicard, Clopitorva, Olmax and sometimes Prazopress when his blood pressure shoots over 170. He also takes appropriate precautions with food and goes for morning and evening walks each for 30 minutes. What is the significance of this fluctuating blood pressure? Are there any risks involved? Do we need to change the medication?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I have read your query, and I have seen the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Firstly, I think that the Atorvastatin dose you are getting may be too low. A dose of 20 mg may be needed at the least, and Clopitorva (Atorvastatin plus Clopidogrel) has only 10 mg. So, I think you need to change it. Secondly, I think I would suggest the vitamin D replacement. A Calcerol (Cholecalciferol) sachet of 60000 units once in a week with a glass of milk should help. Take this for six weeks. Then repeat Vitamin D for seven weeks. Take it on the same day every week. I think Olmesartan that you are getting is a good choice. But the dose may not be sufficient. Since you have not mentioned the dose in the query, I cannot comment on it. Also, considering the fluctuations, I would recommend two doses of Telmisartan instead. This may help keep the blood pressure uniformly stable. Also, he is on too many anti-hypertensives. I usually recommend giving any one and then step up slowly. Personally, I do not understand the query why Clopivas is being given. A blood thinner is usually given in a patient of heart disease or stroke. So, this point you may discuss with the good doctor who initiated the medicine. This is same for Nebicard. I would suggest testing kidney function. I hope this information helps.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Weight loss by liposuction, diet control, exercise, naturopathy, amway, herbalife, etc., is temporary, as all these methods do not have any effect on set point for fat storage. So, any fat that is removed in liposuction will reaccumulate over a period of 6 months to two years. Those who can reduce weight by diet control and exercise does not need liposuction and those who cannot reduce weight by above methods will not reduce even after liposuction.

{"question": "Can sanded grout exposure cause some serious effects? The query is about sanded grout exposure. I am quite concerned about my girlfriend’s exposure to silica dust. We were doing a home renovation. I left for about 1.5 hours while she was removing tile in a kitchen. When I had come back I saw she was removing grout with a grinder and no dust mask. The room was filled with dust in the air. The room is about 10x9 with 12” tiles. This makes for a total cut distance of 1100” with the grinder. Assuming a 1/8” cut with a depth of 3/8” and this works out to 51.56 cubic inches of dust released into the air. Assuming an average of 25 % silica content in the grout and weight of 38 g per cu inch for the dust, that is about 490 grams of silica dust releases into the air. The room was open to adjacent rooms so I estimated about 90 cubic meter space, wich would work out to 5.4 g/m^3. She was doing this for about an hour and a half so I estimate about 1 m^3 was inhaled.

I will attach a photo of the bumps in the back of my mouth. There are two on either side. The bumps on my tongue are too far back to get a proper photo.

(attachment removed to protect patient identity). Since you have mentioned that the ulcers healed two weeks ago and still have few fresh ulcers now, it could be recurrent aphthous mouth ulcers. Aphthous ulcers are usually painful but will not lead to cancerous lesions. But there are small bursts in your palate, which makes me think of viral ulcers as well. You also have a history of HPV (human papilloma virus). Hence, I advise you to take a blood test to rule out viral origin ulcers. Only then the treatment could be framed. You have also mentioned that they are painless now. So there is no need for topical ointments to get rid of the pain. You should also know a fact that topical steroids should not be used for viral lesions. So I request you to complete the blood check and then go ahead with the treatment from a nearby dentist accordingly. Regarding bleeding gums, you have to undertake a complete professional cleaning by a dentist to flush out the dental plaque and chunky substances called calculus. After that, maintain good oral hygiene including flossing, tongue cleaning, and toothbrushing twice a day. Blood test. Avoid hot and spicy food. Take nutritious food rich in vitamins such as green veggies because ulcers could be associated with vitamin B deficiencies. Follow up after three weeks."}

Coming to the cost of the procedure,there are two types of veneers. One is composite veneers which has to be done in the clinic manually by the dentist. But this has short life and a major disadvantage of discoloration. Two, ceramic dental veneers which have to be made in the laboratory and then fixed on the prepared teeth.

If anything of this sort, do meet your doctor immediately and you may need medications to make the uterus quite. It could also be an infection in urinary bladder with a burning sensation while urinating, increased frequency of urination, and feverish feel.

Untreated urinary infections can further lead to pain in the uterus, It could also finally be an infection around the uterus if you had intercourse recently.

{"question": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner-lining will fall off.

{"question": "My lowered left brow is causing droopy eyelids. Will blepharoplasty help? I always had a lower left brow causing the lid to appear more droopy than the right side. However, the skin on the left side has recently become thinner in the past year I would say, causing less of my lid to appear and I feel a sensation now on that eye like something is sitting on my lid. I am only 18 so I feel like I should not be having any issues with my eyes yet. However, I did have Hashimoto's and thyroid cancer and got the thyroid removed and all of my thyroid levels have been stable since then. However, the skin on my left lid never went back to normal. Also, I feel like I might have a little bit of ptosis in both of my eyes, but it does not obstruct my vision. When I look back at old pictures when I was a baby up until the age of 12, my eyelids appear much more open. So is it normal for eyelids to droop as we age?

While in the second picture light reflex is central in both eyes and lower lids are in normal position. Your both upper lids are in a normal position. Normally upper lids cover 1-2 mm cornea superiorly. I would not say these as droopy lids. While in cases of thyroid disease skin changes occur like skin thinning and dryness. So these sensations could be due to hypersensitive skin. For dryness of the skin around the eye or dry eyes, you can use artificial tears. It seems you are thinking too much about it. No significant changes are seen in your eyes or lids after seeing these photos. Just relax. Nothing to worry about and you are absolutely fine. If these are older photos you can send the latest ones. And do not take photos yourself (selfies) because it is not taken in primary gaze (looking straight). I hope this helps."}

{"question": "Will hysterectomy cure adenomyosis? My wife usually has a period for six to seven days. On the first two days, she has pain. At times, she has heavy clots also.

The fundal endometrial thickness is 6.6 mm.' The doctor says the reports are fine. He has asked her to take Regestrone tablet (5 mg) twice a day for 15 days.

She is likely to experience painful menses and heavy bleeding due to adenomyosis as well. Again the report shows an endometrial polyp which can often be the cause of irregular spotting as well and pain in the abdomen. This can be removed by hysteroscopy. Adenomyosis is a form of endometriosis and can grow with each menses. So, ideally, the perfect treatment is to control menses by GnRH analogs or Progesterone-only pills (medical management) and if still not controlled medically and the patient is symptomatic and in unmanageable pain, then hysterectomy is suggested. The plan for giving cyclical Progesterone for 15 days will not apparently help much in her case, as it has been given seeing the thin endometrial wall thickness if she has irregular shedding during mid-cycle which she does not. Also, she is nearing her perimenopausal period. So, the thinning endometrium can be attributed to that. But in either case, cyclical progesterone will not help as the cause is adenomyosis and endometrial polyp for heavy bleeding in her case and not hormonal.

As she has PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), her ovulation date cannot be predicted. So there is always a chance of pregnancy. But as she had bleeding after having tablet Regestrone, pregnancy is not possible. Bleeding after having hormones will be thicker and lesser than normal, that is expected. Once the bleeding occurs, the inner lining of the uterus has fully been shed, so there is no chance of a possible pregnancy to get implanted on the post bleeding, thinned out uterine inner lining. So I do not see any chance of her being pregnant. But if you are still not satisfied or want a further confirmation, have her blood serum beta hCG tested.

In the last three years during the night time, I am suffering from aggressive involuntary movements while asleep. Those movements include kicking in the air and arching and bouncing my back and the whole body.

{"question": "I would like to gradually reduce the dose of Alprazolam. Is that possible? I am taking tablet Alprazolam 5mg (three tablets, a total of 1.5mg) at bedtime. I do not take any Alprazolam or any other benzodiazepines during the day. Also, I started taking Alprazolam about 6-8 months ago. Originally this was for a short period of insomnia due to a life situation where I was so worried about life that I could not sleep. The situation has long passed, and everything is fine now. I would like to slowly wean completely off of the Alprazolam so that. I no longer will take it. I am also being treated for bipolar depression, and I no longer feel depressed at all. But somehow, other benzodiazepines with longer half-lives such as Diazepam, Clonazepam and Clorazepate make me feel quite depressed within an hour or so of taking them. Actually pretty much any benzodiazepine besides Alprazolam makes me feel depressed. So, it seems like I have to wean off of the Alparazolam without substituting longer-acting benzodiazepines. I will go from 1.5mg to 1.25mg for a couple of weeks, then down to 1mg, then 0.75mg, etc., until I am not taking any anymore. At any rate, I am not sure if I am having interdose withdrawal symptoms during the day. I do not think I feel \"anxious,\" though I am not sure exactly what \"anxious\" means, to be honest, even though it is such a common term. I know I do not really spend much time worrying. I generally feel calm and at ease in life and about life. There is really nothing to worry about life because everything is going well for me. But perhaps I *would* be feeling more interdose withdrawal-related anxiety were it not for the antipsychotics and antidepressants I am taking. Perhaps they're ameliorating the anxiety that would have been there during the day between my evening alprazolam doses. But I have noticed lately that I am somehow a bit emotionally labile, at least when it comes to dealing with situations with my girlfriend. It is like she does something little that upsets me, something which I would ordinarily perhaps feel a bit poorly about or get a bit emotionally stirred, and ordinarily we would potentially have a conversation about it to solve this issue, or perhaps we wouldd get into a small fight or something. But lately when something happens which upsets me, it really, really upsets me. I can get easily angered or have some other odd negative emotional reactions. I wonder if this is a problem of interdose withdrawal from Alprazolam? It is possible, too, that it is just a development in my psyche, some kind of psychological problem only manifesting recently. But I wonder if it is possible, too, that I am having this experience as a withdrawal symptom between bedtime doses of Alprazolam. I can be in a perfectly good mood, or in a great mood, or in a normal mood, and one little thing happens with my girlfriend and everything is terrible all of a sudden, I feel terrible and I end up making her feel terrible. Have you heard of anything like this in terms of emotional lability/reactivity or anger or irritability something like that as a result of benzodiazepine withdrawal? Also, if I wanted to test this idea out and divide my bedtime alprazolam dose into, for example, three doses of 0.5mg each, is it possible that I experience insomnia as a nighttime withdrawal symptom? What I mean is that I only had insomnia for a short period due to some anxiety in my life, but that anxiety is over. But now, if I forget to take my 1.5mg alprazolam at nighttime, while I do no start worrying about anything, I just cannot fall asleep. And oddly, if I do start to fall asleep, I am suddenly sort of shocked/jolted back into being awake. This is not the type of insomnia I was being treated for where I just could not sleep because of worrying. I no longer worry or have much to worry about, and I think if I were not dependent on the Alprazolam, I would be sleeping just fine without it. I might be having trouble making this subtle point: It is that while I cannot sleep without my 1.5mg bedtime dose, I do no think it is due to an underlying insomnia, but rather a result of my being dependent on the Alprazolam for sleep after all these months. Is this is possible because of 6-8 months of use? And especially is the feeling of the insomnia is super different than how it was before. Before I just worried and could not sleep, but now there is no worry, I just feel awake in an odd way and cannot sleep, or if not, then I half fall asleep and suddenly startlingly awaken before I am fully asleep. So, now I am thinking of spreading my dose out, and instead of 1.5mg at night, maybe I would take 0.5mg in the morning, 0.5mg sometime later in the day, and 0.5mg before bed. If it is the case that I am experiencing insomnia as a consequence of my dependence on the drug, then would it be probable that I experience the same \"rebound insomnia\" (or whatever it is called) when I spread out the drug? That is, when I spread it out throughout the day and night, should the level of the drug in my blood be enough at nighttime that I do not experience this rebound insomnia? So that if there is some kind of insomnia at nighttime (during this experiment), it is not because of my Alprazolam dependence but rather due to an underlying insomnia? I wonder because I would not want to try this if you think it is probable that I would still have this rebound insomnia. I would only do it if the idea of it makes some sense to you. That is because I am only prescribed enough for 1.5mg per day, and the doctor is not willing to give me some extra during this period, so I have to be careful not to waste any if at all possible so that I'm not missing nights of sleep. Of course, if there's no way to know unless I try it, then I'll try it. But I would only stay away from the experiment if you think it does not make sense. So, if my brain is used to having 1.5mg at bedtime, then even if I took 0.5mg in the morning and 0.5mg in the afternoon, would I still need a whole 1.5mg at bedtime even though I already took 0.5mg morning and 0.5mg afternoon? Would my brain expect the whole amount at night because that is what it is used to, or would it accept that I already had 2/3 the dose morning and afternoon, and so the other 1/3 could be taken before bed? And finally I just want to say that I would like to try this because I am concerned that: 1. This emotional instability is an interdose withdrawal symptom. 2. The longer I am on the drug, the stronger the dependence gets so that it becomes more likely that I develop more severe interdose withdrawal symptoms during the day like panic attacks or something. If either of these are possible, then it would seem like a good idea to spread the dose out in order to avoid these things. Please explain.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Thanks for your detailed query which is self explanatory about the problem. It was lengthy but it contained only relevant thoughts necessary to express your deep rooted concern. First of all feeling nervous or anxious is common term and if you do not know what it means, I am sure you have never had that feeling. If you had that feeling you will know it throughout your life. I must inform you that common terms are difficult to define but almost everybody experiences that. What you are calling as emotional lability/unstability is normal reaction. That happens to any human over the earth. Your calmness and composure with others (except girlfriend) indicates that you are not labile and this is not rebound anxiety. It is possible that you are not satisfied with her relationship to one or another reason. Other than that with partners, having disputes is a normal phenomenon. So, stop calling it emotional lability and set a dialogue with your girlfriend about her doings which upsets you. By doing this you will be identifying the cause and rectify the problem all together. Since it is not rebound insomnia doing experimentation is not advisable. Your question is that if you take 0.5 mg in morning and afternoon what dose will you need in the evening. Since you are doing well with other drugs gradual reduction of the dose of Alprazolam is possible and it can be accomplished successfully by you.

She could not lift her hand, drag the things with her hand.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine concern. Pain and limited range of movement of the shoulder joint can be due to various reasons like fracture of the bones forming the joint, injury to the joint capsule, injury to ligaments of the joint or any muscular injury or spasm or injury to any nerve supplying the joint. The other causes are frozen shoulder, less frequent use of the joint due to pain or injury or some chronic disease. Your mother's symptoms appear to be like frozen shoulder where joint becomes stiff, painful and there is a limitation of the movements of the joint. Frozen shoulder can develop by less use of the joint because of pain, injury, after surgery, chronic diseases such as diabetes or stroke. Frozen shoulder is a self-limiting condition, it nearly always gets better with time. It is diagnosed by physical examination. X-ray can help to see whether symptoms are from other conditions like fracture or arthritis. I suggest you consult an orthopedician. You can follow the mentioned instructions. Apply hot water bag over the joint for 15 to 20 minutes 3 to 4 times a day. You can give her some analgesic, anti-inflammatory medicine like any of the NSAID. Physiotherapy will definitely help. Gentle stretching. It can be prevented by gentle stretching of the joint and using joint more often. Check her random blood sugar.

{"question": "Can HIV tests give false negative results? One and a half years ago, I had unprotected oral sex. Two weeks later I tested positive for HSV-2. I started having sores in my anus. I was prescribed Acyclovir. But, unfortunately, it did not work for me. Four months ago, I had what I believed was ARS with chills, rashes, nausea, and peripheral neuropathy. I then took an HIV fourth generation test which came out negative. However, my symptoms got worse. The sores in my anus did not heal up, and I suddenly developed psoriasis with psoriatic arthritis. I had pain in my joints including fingers, knees, and elbows. My finger nails have also been affected. There was a change in the color of fingernails, and my nails had thickened. More recently, I took a comprehensive STD panel test. It tested for syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, Hepatitis B and C, and Herpes 1 and 2. The only positive one was HSV 1 and 2. Now, I am so worried. I strongly feel that I am infected with HIV, but the fourth generation tests are not picking up the p24 antigen or antibodies for a reason. My last sexual exposure was seven months ago. What other tests can I do to rule out an HIV infection? Since psoriatic arthritis is an immune disorder, could it delay the production of antibodies, hence giving a false negative HIV result? Has my body not produced enough antibodies yet for the test to pick up an HIV infection? How long does the p24 antigen stay detectable in the body following exposure to HIV infection? What are the reasons behind a false negative HIV result? I tested past the three month window period. I tested at five months and seven months post-exposure. Could I have an immunodeficiency that has not been diagnosed and is not making antibodies show up? If antibodies have not been produced by now, will not the p24 antigen still be in the body? How long does the p24 antigen stay in the body? Is there ever a time of HIV infection where both the p24 antigen and antibodies will be missing or too low for the fourth generation tests to pick up? I have read articles online that says there are a few people who do not produce antibodies to HIV at all and they will always have a negative antibody test. How true is that?

Your spotting is not related to PCOS directly. In PCOS, periods become irregular due to anovulation, which leads to heavy bleeding due to unopposed estrogen in body. Simple treatment for it is to take combined oral contraceptive pills for regularizing periods before marriage and when you are not trying for pregnancy. It will also prevent ill effects of unopposed estrogen on endometrium. Another option is to induce regular withdrawal by taking Progesterone tablets (Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg twice daily for 5 days) to induce menses every 30-45 days. Spotting should stop once you start oral contraceptive pills, which you can start right now if you are not trying for pregnancy. To prevent long-term ill effects of PCOS, you need to take healthy diet (low carbohydrate, fat, refined sugars and high in fiber content). Do regular exercise for at least 30-45 minutes daily and induce period by oral contraceptive pill and Progesterone tablets regularly. You should avoid gaining weight at all costs as it may impair glucose tolerance and precipitate diabetes in later life.

{"question": "I am having hip pain due to playing squash. Please advice. I used to have a long-term groin injury from playing badminton which caused jarring pain which ended up me having to stop for a while. I have not played badminton for four years so the groin injury subsided by whenever my groin is stretched it is always tender and has a lot less range of motion compared to the other side. I took up squash a year ago and have been playing at quite a good or intense level five times a week. In the last week, I have had quite a bad hip pain on the same side as my old groin injury. The groin injury has not come back (i.e. jarring, pain, etc.) since starting squash but it has still remained a bit tender when stretched with less range of motion than the other side. The hip pain has started getting bad at night three days ago and affecting my sleep so I have therefore stopped playing. I have been doing resistance band exercises I found online for adductors, abductors, etc., with stretching groin, hamstrings, etc., but has not got better (although it has only been three days).

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "Can anxiety and stress cause frequent urination? I am a 34 year old male. I had anxiety issues since childhood. I have been jumping from one idea to another for a long time but it has been three years I have an issue with frequent urination. It started in a bad time for me when I was obsessing that I have HIV. No burning, just slight urethra burning. I went to a urologist. He told me nothing was wrong, maybe an overactive bladder. I go to the toilet every two hours or three. I never knew what was wrong, but I started to obsess over it and it got worse to a place that my mind is in urination 24/7. I almost gave up until I went on a vacation and during that vacation, I forgot about it totally. The frequency was gone and even the burning urethra. Also, I had to remove my wisdom teeth and when I did, I was so occupied thinking about it that I forgot about urination and I noticed that I do not use the bathroom like I used to. But, I got back obsessing about it again and it got to a point that I urinate a lot of high volumes every hour. It comes suddenly and goes on its own. I use to get those episodes every few months when I had stress but since I got the fear it might never go away I get it almost daily now. I do not know what to do.

{"question": "Will I get rabies infection through mild scratch? I am a 35 year old male. While I was walking in road in possession, two dogs were behind me. When one dog tried to cross me and its front left leg touched my right foot toe. I saw nothing in my foot initially and it happened around 9 AM. At 10 AM, I washed it with soap and I saw a line of 3 cm thick. It resembled the line when we rubber our dry skin. This line disappeared after a wash with soap. Then I saw a skin tag on that line. After that at 11 AM, I rubbed alum on that place but no sensation of burning felt by me. I have a doubt whether the microscopic scratch is covered by alum. Then at noon I used after shave lotion on my foot to check scratches but do not feel any burning sensation. My doubts are as follows. Can scratch without bleeding after washing with soap get sensed by after shave lotion? Why lemon juice cannot create any burning sensation? Is there any break in my toe? Can potash alum find any microscopic scratch that is not visible in bare eye? Can dog claw carry rabies virus? Will I get rabies virus through this scratch?

{"question": "I have severe gum recession in a single tooth. Why? This afternoon I noticed some pretty severe gum recession on my left lower cuspid (approximately 5 mm). As far as I can tell, it is the only tooth with any signs of gum recession, and I think it might be due to crowding (my lateral incisor and first bicuspid are slightly behind and might well be pushing forward) because of that. Is this an urgent issue for a dentist or can it wait, and if so, is there anything I can do to help the issue?", "prediction": "For further information consult a dentist online -->", "reference": "It is okay. You do not need to rush to the dentist. The clinical scenario of teeth that you told indicates that most probably this gum recession is caused by yourself. You brush like giving a slight high power stroke on right and left bicuspids and then with normal force on rest of the teeth. Because of high-pressure stroke, gums in that particular area goes down, causing sensitivity of tooth. Another cause could be plaque or tartar around that particular tooth causing gums infection that results in receding gums. But still, I think it is your brushing technique that is the main cause of receding gum. Tell me about it. You just have to change your brushing technique, do not do harsh brushing in that area. Take a soft bristle tooth brush. Avoid severe hot or cold food stuff till you visit your dentist. Rest treatment will be done later by the dentist and that could be scaling or filling of abrasion. Stay happy and blessed. Take care."}

If at all it is because of potatoes you should get it immediately after eating and not after eating for a month. Most of the people will have an allergy to milk and milk products or lactulose intolerance. Most common food products that cause allergy are milk and milk products, eggs, fish, nuts like almonds, cashews, peanuts, walnuts, soy, or wheat (as seen in patients with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity). Have you been evaluated for other gastric disorders by a gastroenterologist? It would be better if I could see all your reports and treatment given so far by your doctor. You need to observe keenly about the food type that is causing the allergy. Avoiding the food that is responsible is the best way to avoid allergic reactions.

{"question": "I have idiopathic spastic intestinal obstruction. Can you specify the exact location? I have a rare disease called idiopathic spastic intestinal obstruction/spastic ileus with chronic, long-term course (barium stays about 40 hours in the small intestine). On a two-balloon endoscopy of the small intestine, colonoscopy with ileoscopy, CT, MRI revealed nothing. So, we can determine the location of spasm only with X-ray and barium follow through. I did barium follow through several times (with an interval of six months). There was a disagreement among the doctors and they agreed about etiology of obstruction (dynamic/spastic), but cannot decide the location of the spasm. Treatment recommended is therapeutical - endoscopic injections of Botulinum toxin into the intestine (they call it chemical denervation, and recommend it because that conservative drug therapy does not help. Therefore, it is important to know the exact location of spasm. I ask for help in this matter. I am attaching the links. The study was started 11 and half hours after swallowing barium. The last shot was taken 35 hours after swallowing barium. So, there is stasis/stagnation about 30 hours in the small intestine. The most important question is the exact location of the spastic area. It is important to know the location and length of spasm in centimeters, at least in some ranges (if absolute accuracy is not possible, but if it is possible, at least within the margin of error of a few cm, that would be perfect).

{"question": "I am doing good with anti-anxiety medicines, except sleepiness. What to do? I am a 47 year old male suffering from anxiety disorder and being treated for OCD specifically. A year ago, I was prescribed Zoloft 100 mg (Sertraline). But after three months I have transferred to Prozac 40 mg (Fluoxetine) together with Risperdal 0.5 mg (Risperidone).

Risperidone can cause sedation, but you are using only a small dosage, and it is in the night I believe. Here, using Amphetamine to counteract sleepiness is not recommended instead you can try using a drug called as Modafinil, which is available at a dose of 100 mg. Try it in the morning to prevent sleepiness and to concentrate better. If you are experiencing worsening of OCD symptoms after reducing Fluoxetine to half, then it is advisable to bring it to therapeutic dosage range in OCD, which is 60 to 80 mg.

So, I went to my doctor and he thinks I have rheumatoid arthritis. He says it starts in the feet and hands. Blood workup is totally normal for RA factor and inflammatory markers. This is causing me severe anxiety. He did not take X-rays but says he can see changes in my hands. They look the same to be as I am petite and have always had bony hands. He is a rheumatologist but did not even touch my hands to examine them. I have had no fevers, tiredness, anemia, etc. Just now a lot of anxiety over this.Can this be allergies with some slight osteoarthritis? Stress inflammation? Also, I am starting menopause as I am 48 years old, no period since last month. Hormones? I do have a slightly swollen gland under right ear and right side of throat is sore from postnasal drip, also had cold sores in the mouth. I do not know if a virus can affect this also. I will upload the blood report.", "prediction": "For further information consult a rheumatologist online -->", "reference": "Well, as per your clinical history and symptoms it does look like nodal osteoarthritis of the hands. My point in favor: 1. DIP joints are never involved in rheumatoid arthritis. If they are inflamed we have to think of alternative diagnosis. Either OA or psoriatic arthritis. But from your history, it seems more like nodal osteoarthritis with Herbedens nodes and Bouchard's nodes. 2. If it was rheumatoid even if seronegative ESR and CRP should have risen but they have not. So, it is unlikely there is any inflammation going on. 3. As per your feet, it looks like you developed plantar fascitis. Would recommend you to start wearing sports shoes and do some compressions in a hot water tub. That should help. Apart from it, the swollen gland may be due to a viral infection only which I am hoping should settle in due course. But yes, if you need a final confirmation, best is to ask for an ultrasound of hands and feet that would tell us if there is inflammation or not as X-rays may not pick up early changes. Ultrasound of hand. OA of hands."}

After a miscarriage and two weeks bleeding, how and why stress on normal periods immediately as body and hormonal cycle need time to develop and to start all over. After that post unprotected intercourse, you took another hormone as an emergency contraceptive that can have further side effects on your body. My suggestion now is to use no more hormones as already lots of natural and induced hormonal events took place and body has had enough to bear lots of inductions. So, now just wait to have a natural cycle to start itself as these emergency contraceptives only can delay, irregulate cycles and can show mood variations, spotting, etc. Have healthy nutritious diet as dieting can also delay period. Have walk daily. Again reminding you, try to avoid lots of hormones as the body also needs time to respond and regulate itself.

Eat bland diet. Avoid milk, spicy and fatty food. Preferably eat bananas, rice and other light food. Loose motion should subside by this. However, if it is not controlled in a day or two, take tablet O2 (Ofloxacin and Ornidazole combination) twice a day for 5 days. This is an antibiotic which is useful in bacterial infections.

It is contraindicated in moderate to severe uncontrolled hypertension. So considering you are having the lowest possible dose and your observation that it is not affecting BP readings, Dextroamphetamine can be continued. However, keep watch on blood pressure. Now, mentioned BP reading is fine and you should continue the same antihypertensive. If needed, we can increase Amlodipine to 10 mg. Regarding cholesterol, LDL is significantly higher. You should do vigorous lifestyle modifications and if you are already doing then it is better to initiate medicines like tablet Rosuvastatin at bedtime. Otherwise, you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily, and high-calorie diet. Also, have a low salt diet. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according to your capacity at least 30 minutes a day and five days a week. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. Try to lose some weight and bring BMI down. Recheck cholesterol after two to three months, if there is response it is fine, otherwise, you will need medicines.

{"question": "I have ulcers, sore throat, and oral thrush with swallowing difficulty. Please help. I am a 22-year-old female. I have some mouth and throat concerns. I have ulcers, sore throat, occasional oral thrush, difficulty swallowing, lump on the throat (larynx), night sweats, fever, loose teeth, and abnormal discoloration in mouth. I am currently on birth control patch, Dextro-amphetamine and Cymbalta. I have been struggling for months now with quite a few mouth and throat issues. I have constant mouth ulcers that are taking weeks to heal, I get the sensation that I have not swallowed something completely down and that it stuck so I will keep swallowing and swallowing it drives me mad. It is not easy for me to keep doing this because swallowing feels harder than it should be almost like my throat is too swollen. I have a sore throat 80% of the time. I have odd waves of oral thrush and my mouth also has pale and red areas on my soft palate, my hard palate is just very pale. I have a couple of loose teeth but otherwise in very good shape. Frequent random nose bleeds that are usually heavy but can be light at times. Night sweats every night and feeling easily overheated during the days. I have also now become more concerned since my throat developed a hard lump on the top of my larynx. It feels very swollen where it is almost like it is ready to explode. It does not move and it stays firm putting a lot of pressure on my throat. I am assuming this is why it feels hard to swallow. It does not hurt but if I push on it to feel the firmness it causes discomfort to the surroundings mostly underneath the lump.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "First and foremost, I would advise you not to panic or get disheartened. According to me, there is no major issue out there and we usually encounter such issues very often in our outpatient department. Now looking at your case, oral ulcers can be due to various causes right from nutritional and vitamin deficiencies to infections or repeated trauma. Getting each and every parameter tested often becomes extremely expensive and might frustrate you even more. Coming to your second major concern, difficulty in swallowing with no major pain as such can be due to some ulcers down in your throat, or infection in your pharynx (throat), or constant gastric irritation. Advice: 1. Consider taking a good multivitamin for two to three months. 2. Follow a healthy, hygienic lifestyle. 3. Avoid smoking, alcohol, etc. 4. Avoid having spicy, oily, and junk food items. 5. Salt water gargles at least 8 to 10 times a day. You should keep your oral cavity free from contaminating organisms and hence the throat infection. 6. Keep sipping on boiled warm water. 7. Consider antireflux therapy if you have the slightest of reflux issues. 8. Get your viral markers for HIV, HbsAg and blood sugars done too. 9. Do not Google too much of your symptoms out. 10. Do not correlate too many unnecessary things and do not take stress at any cost, sometimes stress can be responsible for non-healing ulcers."}

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "Is there any way to avoid tightening of calf muscles? I feel like my calf muscles are gonna pull and I want to prevent it. It does not hurt, but I can feel the tightness. What should I do to stop this? I am scared.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "This sounds like calf tightness, but it may be a few other things that are more concerning. If the tightness is only in one calf, you need to get follow up, especially if you are on birth control or have another risk for blood clots. Depending on your age, you may be at risk for problems with your blood vessels that can cause calf pain when walking. Calf tightness is very common especially in athletes and in women who wear high heels and is usually from overuse of muscles that have not been stretched properly, causing inflammation and tired muscles. For treatment, I suggest starting with a massage to the area, which can include rolling your calves on a foam roller or even a small ball. There are specific trigger points that are particularly helpful in treating the knot in your muscles. Do this for several minutes a few times a day. For treatment and prevention, research a few calf stretching exercises and do those several times a day as well. Another important thing for sore muscles is hydration and electrolyte repletion. If you are doing exercise, remember to stretch for 15 to 20 minutes before and after, and ice your calves after exercise. Finding out if your tightness is more due to inflammation or fatigue can be helpful in guiding a more personalized treatment plan, but would require more questions. Also, it would help figure out if you may also have a strain or even small tears that would need to be treated more carefully. Delayed onset of a muscle disorder, muscle strain."}

A black layer is formed at the backside of teeth. When I see my teeth it seems very dirty and too much of creamy layer is formed on my teeth especially in lower canines and lower incisors. In the lower teeth, yellowness is 'V' shaped and in upper incisors the creamy layer is much lesser than the lower ones. The creamy layer gets removed by using my nails on that, but toothpowder is not able to remove that yellownees. I am feeling very sad while seeing my dirty teeth. My molar and premolar teeth have a black spot on them and people told me it is eaten by tooth worm. Is it true that tooth worm damages the teeth? When I contacted a local doctor he did scaling procedure. Just after scaling procedure, all the yellowness was clear (almost 80%) and black layer at the backside was also clear. I became very happy by seeing this. But about a month after scaling, my teeth again turned much yellowish and looks very bad and black layer at the backside of teeth also started appearing. Is scaling only a temporary process and is it complete wastage of money? For clean teeth, is there any permanent thing which will make our teeth very much white and glowing?", "prediction": "For further information consult a dentist online -->", "reference": "Yellowing of teeth is mainly due to one of the following or a combination of these: You have given an excellent description of the clinical condition of your oral cavity. From your history it is very clear that, the yellowness of your teeth is due to plaque and calculus deposits. Plaque as you have mentioned is yellowish and creamy. This gets partially removed with brushing. Calculi are hard deposits either yellowish, greenish or sometimes blackish in color. They are firmly attached to the teeth and do not go off with brushing or tooth powder. Even the abrasiveness of the tooth powder cannot remove the calculi. During childhood due to improper brushing there are chances of plaque and calculus formation over the teeth. Because children at this age tend to be playful and do not concentrate on oral hygiene. \"Tooth worms\" as people say are nothing but bacteria that affect the teeth. These bacteria act on the teeth and cause demineralization of the teeth and lead to tooth decay and cavities. The lower incisors and canines are more prone to plaque and calculus deposition (v shaped deposition in accordance with the tooth morphology) due to inability of us to reach the inner sides of these teeth while brushing. At this age of yours, these deposits may be due to: Dental scaling is the procedure that removes plaque and calculi. But it does not mean that these deposits will not come back again. Continuous oral hygiene maintenance after scaling is mandatory to prevent recurrence of plaque and calculi. Hence, scaling is not a wastage of money, it is an investment to prevent one's teeth and gums from infections and thereby increase the life of the teeth. So, a permanent solution for your problem is to follow these steps to maintain oral hygiene: And finally, pearl white color of the teeth indicate that they are unhealthy. Teeth which are slightly yellow, without any deposits on them are said to be healthy. Hope this answer helps you. Consult a dentist online for further follow up -->"}

This time it came after 40 days with a spot of bleeding and no bleeding for three days after which normal bleeding has lasted for around eight days making it a total eleven days. This has never happened before and is worrying. Should we take this as some of the instance and continue monitoring or should we do some doctor followup?

Delayed or absent ovulation. It is normal to have occasional cycle anovulatory and in such a case period will be delayed and heavy. If this is the case, there should be no need to worry as such an episode will not recur frequently. She might have been pregnant and it was early abortion and so heavy bleeding. Condom, used for contraception has a high failure rate and it is better to use some better contraception like oral pills or CuT (copper T). If bleeding has stopped completely, again, there should be no reason to worry. You can confirm whether she was pregnant by doing a simple urine pregnancy test. If it comes positive, you need to consult a gynecologist once for further management. Repeat the ultrasound if such episodes recur."}

{"question": "Is laminectomy an only option for lumbar spinal stenosis? I have had back pain for the last 12 years. I had an l5 s1 disc herniation and later diagnosed with severe lumbar spinal stenosis at l4 l5 as well. My back pain is more critical than the leg pain. However, I have persistent calf and foot spasms and cramping (especially in bed and at night). I am able to exercise and lift heavy objects, but not able to walk more than a mile at a time. I believe the stenosis is more of an issue right now than the disc herniation, and my MRI confirms the disc is not as bad as it was years ago. I have done physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractor, and epidural injections, but, my lower back pain remains an issue (especially when standing and walking for a long time). My doctors recommend a laminectomy, though I am scared that surgery may leave me in worse shape than I currently am. Can I have some advice?

You should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly thrice a day for one week and then once or twice a week.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "There is no improvement in my father's cough. What to do? My father is 67 years old. His past history included pneumonia several years ago, leg cramps once in every two weeks or so and vitamin B helps with it and minor daily coughing of unsure cause. He never smoked and does not drink alcohol. Three and a half weeks ago, he went to the ER due to severe chest pain. His EKG was apparently unconcerned, chest x-ray was clear, CT scan of the chest was normal and all the laboratory tests were normal. He was given Morphine and Nitro and the chest pain got resolved. He was sent home the same night with Nitro prescription and an appointment to see a cardiologist. He saw cardiologist one and a half weeks ago. His cardiologist said that his EKG reveals AFib and not happy with a CT scan of the chest due to poor timing of filming versus contrast injection. He placed him on Diltiazem, Eliquis and Nitro prn. Also, he placed him on a cardiac monitor at home and given a follow up in two weeks.After the cardiologist appointment, my dad started getting a horrible dry, hacking cough, which gets worse every day. He is unable to sleep. He can only sleep on the chair here and there. Strangely, when he lies down, the cough subsides. It resumes immediately on sitting up and walking around. I finally convinced him to call the cardiologist about severe unrelenting cough since being put on new medicines. Then, we met the cardiologist and had a heart monitor read. As the cough still persists, chest x-ray was ordered and no pneumonia, but fluid was found around his heart. So, the cardiologist has placed him additionally on Digoxin, Lasix and Potassium along with Cardizem, Eliquis and Nitro prn. He is asked to wear monitor longer and given next appointment after three weeks.Now, he is on the third day of medication and no change was observed in cough or inability to sleep.

Even if noted anything above 1 in 250 is not to be worried about at all. Even echocardiography will be normal and post-delivery follow up will be normal. Brownish discharge in first three months of pregnancy is normal. When the embryo implants, the minimal blood which comes due to the burrowing embryo will clot and come out within first three months of pregnancy. Even without the progesterone, the clot will resolve. So do not consider it as a problem. Pregnancy is a cholestatic state and liver enzymes will raise. But that is quite early as you mentioned.

But unfortunately, these drugs have some side effects, not necessarily mental wise but some physical adverse effects such as dry mouth, dry eyes, and can sometimes lead to constipation and also could cause increased sleep.

I will tell in detail about the foods that you need to include in your diet. Include nuts in your diet especially almonds, peanuts, hazelnuts. All types of nuts have healthy fats in them which have been proved to be healthy by a bundle of researches done over the years. They do not have cholesterol and the fat in them does not lead to weight gain. Instead, studies are consistently showing that nuts lower the cholesterol levels of an individual. Nuts can prove very beneficial to have satiety (satisfaction) and in improving your blood glucose levels. They can control your hunger prangs while providing you satisfaction. In this way, they can assist in weight loss. You can include nuts in your breakfast or can consume it as a snack in between meals. You can eat a handful of them or you can add them to your cereal, plain cornflakes, weetabix, porridge, sagudana, kheer, gravy or raw/boiled salads. You can also consume them in the form of milkshakes e.g. almond milkshake or you can simply mix almond or walnut powder in milk and consume it as a mid-morning snack or as an evening snack or before bed. Homemade almond or peanut butter is also good. You can use honey or brown sugar 1.5 tablespoons on a daily basis. Include seeds in your diet (basil seeds, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds). You can season them on your salads, in your milk, milkshakes, yogurt, porridge. Basil seeds need to be soaked in water before use. Chia seeds are eaten both raw as well as soaked. Pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds are eaten raw. Use olive oil. Season it on your salads, egg, toast, fish, lean meat. Extra virgin olive oil can be used for cooking as well. You can use edible corn oil, sunflower oil, mustard oil, soy bean oil for cooking. Add more vegetables and fruits in your diet. Use more green leafy vegetables. Add whole grains in your diet (whole wheat, oats, barley). Do not use refined and polished flours. White flour is also a refined flour. Use fish, poultry, red meat (use lean cuts). Use low-fat dairy products and sugar-free as well. Strain milk before use. Make home-made yogurt using strained milk. Do not drink any kind of juice or fizzy drinks. Juice made from juicer is also not allowed. If one wants to drink juice, simply add one recommended fruit in water and grind it in a milk shake jug. Do not add sugar. You can use boiled rice or tarke wala chawal twice a week only (one small plate). Do not consume rice in dinner. I hope this helps. Do not add sugar or artificial sweeteners in your daily foods. Do not use commercially prepared nut spreads. Do not use nuts with sauces, mayonnaise as both of them are fattening. Do not use nuts with added salt in them if you suffer from high blood pressure. Do not use margarine. Do not use flavored cornflakes. Limit the consumption of canned and tinned foods, biscuits, cakes and desserts."}

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

This method is most effective when used within 72 hours after having unprotected sex. To follow the Yuzpe method, you should take your birth control pills (Yasmin) in two doses, 12 hours apart. Each dose has four pills. So you should retake four pills after 12 hours to complete the regimen and then in the next 48 to 72 hours, you can expect a withdrawal bleed."}

Normally period starts between 3 and 15 days of stopping the last tablet in the pack. If it has been more than 15 days since last tablet, consult a gynecologist. If it has been less than 15 days, she can wait till 15 days from last pill for periods to come. In any case, she cannot start next pack without having periods unless instructed by doctor after examination.

So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density.

There are two types of aging going on in an individual. Intrinsic aging that is inherited (in our genes) and the other is extrinsic aging (that is due to environmental factors most importantly the sunlight). With aging, the following things happen across the decades: 1. Collagen in our skin becomes less resulting in wrinkles. The process of degeneration of collagen gets aggravated by the exposure to sunlight due to the formation of reactive oxygen species. 2. Natural moisturizing factor and hydration of skin get low and skin becomes more dry and scaly. 3. Hair follicles in our skin and sebaceous glands also become less with time resulting in few hairs on the body. 4. Elastic tissue becomes less in the skin resulting in crows feet, fine lines, and sagging of skin. 5. Sunlight exposure and extrinsic aging lead to melanin synthesis and freckles, lentigines formation on exposed areas. Skincare: Protection from sunlight is advised. A good sunblock of SPF 60 (sun protection factor) should be used. Vitamin C cream can be used. Plenty of water should be taken. Consuming fresh fruits and vegetables with antioxidant properties are very important. Acid toning can be started around 30 years of age when skin requires rejuvenation. Topical retinoids are very important in skin rejuvenation. They decrease wrinkles, they increase collagen synthesis and give glow and decrease fine lines from the skin."}

Firstly, I would like to give an honest opinion about your question that is will the braces further create more cracks in your original teeth? So answer is yes if you will go for conventional orthodontic treatment (in which manually metal brackets are put on teeth) and I would say no if you will go for invisible aligner type orthodontic treatment (in it only invisible tray is given to wear, no bracketing is involved). Secondly, I would like to give my suggestion regarding your case. I would suggest going for ortho treatment inspite of the fact your tooth enamel is weaken. If your teeth are severly malaligned, crowded or you have any difficulty in eating, air passage, etc., like there is a genuine cause that needs to be corrected through ortho braces because you are 20 and it is an ideal age for treatment. More you delay, more it will become difficult for teeth to move. Treatment will take more time as age grows older like one year treatment at 20 might take two and a half year time at age 30. If there is no severe ortho issue and you want braces just for a cosmetic reason then I would suggest you to avoid ortho treatment. If you opt for doing ortho braces treatment then your enamel might get weakened due to bracketing but later you can get it fixed by veneering procedure. It will look fine later. Hopefully, you will be able to decide well now about what treatment you should go for. I might give a better opinion after seeing picture of your teeth."}

The longest time has been three months of bleeding.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "As your gynecologist must have explained that uterine fibroids are benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus, usually found in childbearing age. Small fibroids usually do not have any symptom and do not require any treatment, but as you have excessive bleeding and other symptoms, you need treatment. After menopause, they usually decrease in size. Fibroids usually do not have any proper cause, but there are some risk factors which may produce fibroids in a lady like obesity, smoking, parity, low thyroid level, low physical activity, excessive consumption of red meat, etc. Fibroids are usually dependent on female hormones estrogen and progesterone, which may contribute to control further bleeding and cramps. Along with contraceptive pills, other symptomatic treatments are given in fibroids like painkillers, Iron supplements, etc. Surgery is required in cases where fibroids keep on increasing, despite all management. But, if you are not willing to take medicines, you can go for ayurvedic management for fibroids which are also very effective if taken properly. First of all, if you are overweight then try to reduce your weight with the help of yoga, exercise, walk, etc. You can take help of a professional trainer to learn some exercises. If you want to practice yoga on your own, then do practice these yoga postures as they will help you a lot in your problem. If you have a thyroid problem, then do take proper medication for it, as it will also help in relieving your problem. Due to excessive bleeding, your body might be iron deficient. So, along with iron supplementation take foods which are rich in iron, like green leafy vegetables, fruits like apple, peach, banana, prune, raisins, etc. Take one glass of warm milk and add a teaspoon of turmeric and coriander powder, mix well and take two times a day. Turmeric is very helpful for fibroid treatment. Include kidney beans and black eyed beans in your daily diet, as they help reduce the estrogen levels. If you eat fish, then you can take once or twice a week, fishes like salmon and tuna have some anti-inflammatory properties and help counter fibroids. Avoid junk food, excessive caffeinated drinks like tea, coffee, cold drinks, and red meat, smoking and alcohol. You can take following ayurvedic medicines which are very effective in uterine fibroids. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking medicines after their consent. Follow all the above dietary and lifestyle changes and take all the medicines regularly and you will soon feel positive results. Consult after one month regarding the results.

He has been suffering from type 2 diabetes for over 20 years and three years ago was prescribed to use Insulin. Recently, his doctor told him that his blood sugar is under control. He experienced previous imbalance feeling and fell several times while walking in past. Basically, whenever he stood up, he would need an effort to gain his balance. His hands also have been shaking a bit. He had an open heart surgery 10 years ago. He had a back pain (even in laying down position) which went worse after the accident. He has lost a majority of his vision over the years due to glaucoma. His X-ray indicates no broken bone.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Welcome to icliniq.com. I read carefully your question and would explain that this clinical situation could be caused by a stroke, which is probably the cause of falling. Another possible cause would be a nerve damage related to the trauma. For this reason, it is important performing a brain CT (computed tomography) scan or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to investigate for a possible stroke. If this test result is normal, I would recommend performing a nerve conduction study to examine his nerves. For more information consult a neurologist online -->"}

{"question": "Am I getting irritation in the leg due to cervical region injury? I got hit on the left side on cervical region almost two years from now.

Symptoms also still exist on left arm and trapezius but recently for the first time, I started feeling some irritations in the left leg too. My questions are the following: How this will progress you think? MRI shows nothing significant anatomically but radiculopathy deteriorates and emg results. Is this possible you think to start having the same problems in the leg too? This will constitute kind of myelopathy. Is it?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Regarding your concern, I would explain that as there are no signs of myelopathy or spinal canal compression on MRI, there is no reason to panic about myelopathy. The pain in this region is related to the nerve damage. Physiotherapy can help improve your situation. I would also recommend trying a cervical collar during pain exacerbation. I do not think that it will progress. It is also important avoiding heavy weight lifting and use an orthopedic pillow. Regarding the irritation on the leg, I would recommend performing a lumbar spine X-ray study in order to investigate for possible chronic degeneration or the lumbar vertebral column, which may mimic this clinical situation."}

So, it is suggested that you should get your serum progesterone levels done on day 21 of your cycle. If they are less than 21 g/dL, then you may need to be placed on cyclical progesterones to avoid such episodes of intermenstrual bleeding. Also other causes can be endometrial polyp, fibroid or even sometimes ovulation mid-cycle bleeds, which is so often confused for abnormal uterine bleeding. If the test is normal, then the next step would be to get an ultrasound pelvis to rule the above causes. However, such bleeds if in excess can be acutely controlled with antifibrinolytics like Tranexamic acid tablets, which can control such episodes.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "Will cutting down of Xanax dose lead to additional psychological disturbance? I have been taking 4 mg of Xanax a day to treat severe panic attack syndrome and associated high levels of general anxiety for 15 years. My doctor arrived at the 4 mg per day amount gradually and it works very well along with CBT from a therapist. Before two months, when I received the medication from the pharmacy it was for 3 mg /day. I asked them to double check and that was the quantity that my doctor had written. I call his office and the office manager said that she would ask him about it. When I called the next day she said that he did not make a mistake and I asked for an explanation and was told that he did not give one. I started to feel sick a few days later and panic attacks actually started to increase the day that I talk to his office manager. I suffered minor but disruptive withdrawal symptoms physically and mentally for about two weeks and then they subsided but panic attacks continued to occur at random every day and my GAD symptoms increased to the point where CBT methods were not working. Then last month, the script was back to 4 mg per day normal dosage. I thought yes, back to normal. But again this month the script was back down to 3 mg per day which means I am going to experience a minor hell again. I am a defense and aerospace engineer who works on a contract basis through an agency and the client had noticed a drop in my performance before month but back to normal last month, now they are going to see it again and I will probably lose the contract job. I also started online system engineer classes and I am freaking out over being able to handle the exams and homework as I typically work on the class at night and am now without my evening dose. I again asked for an explanation and was not given any. My question is a 25% cut in dosage physically dangerous and I am well aware of the strong psychological addition issues, so will this settle down before my career and social life and general well being take a hit and I revert to hiding in my apartment with my dog and my employer and friends will give up on me.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "There are a few clarifications and advice that I need to make. Reducing the dosage of Alprazolam results in Alprazolam withdrawal. A reduction by 25% is unlikely to be physically dangerous but the withdrawal symptoms are going to be highly unpleasant. The anxiety of withdrawal is quite similar to your panic and generalized anxiety and it is difficult to make a difference between the two. Withdrawal anxiety will reduce over time. I do not think that your disease will worsen because of this to the initial level but the withdrawal will cause distress for a few weeks. I recommend using more nonpharmacological therapies like relaxation training during this period. Ask your doctor to avoid making sharp changes in dose and consider adding drugs like SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), etc. Breaking your tablets and taking the pieces in such a way so that you reduce the inter dose interval without changing the dose. I hope this helps."}

Please help.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I had gone through all the details posted. The difference in size of the testicles is mainly because of two reasons, orchitis and hydrocele. Orchitis is inflammation of the testicles, which has happened three years back due to mumps. There will be redness, pain and no fluid around the testis. For decrease of swelling and pain, we need to use anti-inflammatory agents. If there is any bacterial infection, then we need to use antibiotics. In case of hydrocele, if the inflammation is more, then the fluid will be formed around the testis, which needs ultrasound and clinical examination for diagnosis. If there is fluid around the testis, then it can be removed by surgery. If you have hydrocele, there is chance for rejection to foreign countries. So, you may need to be operated. If it is only different size of the testis and no fluid, then there may not be a chance for rejection. So, you need to consult a general surgeon and get an ultrasound of the scrotum for further management. For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->"}

{"question": "Why am I having elevated lymphocytes? For the past five years, my absolute lymphocytes have been 4.2 to 4.9 range, never going over 5 (I have had multiple CBC's and every single one of my absolute lymphocytes is elevated). However, they have been continually elevated to the point that I was recently sent to a hematologist who initially thought I had CLL, but the flow cytometry test came back negative, then he did a T-cell gamma rearrangement test, also negative. At that point, he decided it must be autoimmune and sent me back to my PCP. Several years earlier when all this started, I woke up with joint pain, swelling and was sent to a Rheumatologist who decided I had RA despite every RA test being negative, and the joint swelling is not following what is clinically seen in RA (my joints were not bilaterally swollen, red, or hot. They were randomly swelling in my hands, feet and were really painful). So, I refused to take Methotrexate because I had no positive RA tests and after about a year, the swelling went down, the pain faded away and I have had no other flares since that time. So, my question is, should I try to get to the bottom of my chronically elevated absolute lymphocyte and if so, are there any other tests I should have my PCP pursue? I do not want to blame it on the RA when there is no proof I ever had RA but at this point, five years of elevated absolute lymphocytes are concerning to me and I feel like it is indicative of something, but I do not know what.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "If you have any type of leukemia especially CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) or MBL (monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis) then it could have been reflected in the peripheral smear examination report or in flow cytometry investigation.

So for that, you need to investigate with serum ANA estimation, ESR estimation and then if needed full autoimmune cell panel can be run to exclude any possibility of autoimmune disorder.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it?

Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

This is mandatory to justify rising CA125 levels which indicate epithelial ovarian cancer. Once that is clear, then you should ideally opt for IVF- ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) procedure with wife ovum and husband sperm pre-genetic implantation diagnosis (PGD) of the embryo to rule out any age-related congenital anomalies followed by embryo transfer and maintenance of pregnancy on progesterone support and IVF drugs. Considering that fibroids usually do not support IVF pregnancy but they are presently small and once implantation and growth occur, they shall thin out, so still best is IVF. If the cause of raised CA125 levels turns out to be malignant, then pregnancy should not be opted for and treatment for malignancy would take priority."}

Secondly, you need to get his endoscopy done again and one digital chest X-ray. Once these reports are done, send it to me all the reports along with your query. You must stop all oily food, must keep checking his sugar levels. He should not develop diabetes and if he will then stop his sugar intake, give him more soups and boiled food items only, always avoid raw food like salads and stuff.

Medicines are usually given for two to four months and then tapered off slowly and stopped. Things like St Johns wort, Eltroxin, etc., will only add to the effect of the primary antidepressant. It will never be a substitute for the medicines. Still, if you wish to try these, you can take St Johns wort twice a day, and also take L-Theanine 200 mg once or twice a day. L-Theanine is also an over the counter dietary supplement which shows good results for anxiety. If you have sleeping issues, you can take Melatonin 5 mg over the counter supplement at night.

{"question": "Is surgery the suggested treatment option for breast cancer in situ? My mother is 68 years old. She was just diagnosed with breast cancer in situ. The medical team says it is not aggressive. The hospital in which she was treated already did a biopsy on her breast. I read today that biopsies can actually open the door to cancerous cells and allow the spread. Also, her surgery is already scheduled for this week. I also read that surgery at such an early stage may cause more problems than there was original. I read an article online. I do not know how reliable it is? Also, in my place, doctors follow a protocol, they will not offer anything but the conventional way which is surgery, no alternative treatments are suggested. What is your advise?", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "I have gone through your reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As far as I was able to understand, the lesion is a high grade (microcalcification and necrosis). Though I had to use google translation. What I am going to tell you is as per recognized and approved evidences it does not include newer theories and understanding which are though upcoming have not yet come in clinical practice. High-grade DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) increases the risk of invasive cancer. What above article has mentioned regarding mortality being the same in DCIS patients and normal individuals is not totally correct. The study which showed mortality of three percent, these patients were treated and it is not sure whether the similar mortality is due to treatment or nature of the disease. The medical community is clear that some DCIS are low grade and may not need treatment and thus have removed DCIS from premalignant. But high-risk DCIS increases risk of having invasive component which might be missed just by biopsies. There is some evidence that we can avoid RT (radiotherapy) in low risk group, but none of the mainstream studies have avoided surgery. The use of hormonal therapy is to avoid recurrence. Now the above article mentions that it does not change overall mortality. But this is due to the fact that we usually detect recurrences earlier and treat them before progressing to advanced stage. If we have not then there is a chance that some of them will progress to aggressive disease. Regarding biopsy there is enough evidence that it does not increase the chance of cancer spreading. These are just hypotheses. Also, it definitely does not affect overall prognosis. Lastly, being from a medical background I do not have an idea regarding natural treatment. Though I would say that all these are just hypotheses and not proven things. As per my idea, she would need a breast conservation therapy plus radiotherapy, and endocrine treatment depending on the final biopsy result. DCIS. Wide local excision, radiotherapy and endocrine therapy depending on the final report, hormone status and invasive component. Six monthly mammography."}

However, these are not causing me significant stress and my BP has not shot up this much before. I get fevers on and off and take Paracetamol for them. Just before this started, I was feeling extremely depressed and took eight 25 mg Phenergan tablets with two Co-dydramol tablets (500 mg/10 mg).

Two days after I took the load, I was having horrible acid reflux and burning pain. When I talk to a doctor on the phone, he suggested that my thoughts of it being a stomach or peptic ulcer may have been correct.

{"question": "I am suffering from anxiety. Please help. I am suffering from anxiety. Please help.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Your description of symptoms is concise and specific, which makes it easy to diagnose your condition. Mental illnesses are broadly classified into neurosis and psychosis. In neurosis, a person does not lose contact with reality and understands that he has a mental issue known as insight into illness. The person is concerned about it and actively seeks help, just like you. All anxiety disorders fall under neurosis. Conversely, in psychosis, a patient losses contact with reality for example false perception like voices talking or false belief like a delusion that people are planning to kill him. These patients refuse to believe that they have a mental problem and they resist any sort of treatment. Schizophrenia is a classic example of psychosis. Patients of neurosis do not convert into psychosis. Anxiety remains as anxiety no matter how severe or chronic it is. So, be assured that you are not going to become schizophrenic, lose your mind or land in a mental hospital. Anxiety disorder has multiple presentations like generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, etc. Depersonalization also occurs in anxiety disorder. Frequently, these conditions coexist in varying severities at different points of time. Your description suggests that at a certain level, you realize that your fear is irrational, but you still cannot get it out of your mind. This is likely to be an obsessive thought. The characteristics of an obsessive thought are :- Despite this, you are unable to kick it out of your mind or prevent thinking about it. There is a proven helpful way of dealing with an obsessive thought. Try a deep breathing technique like the 4-7-8 technique (relaxed breathing) which you can find on the internet and use it whenever you feel more anxious. Lastly, if you feel the need of taking medicine to deal with it, you should choose an antianxiety drug like Clomipramine or Fluvoxamine which has proven efficacy against obsessive symptoms as well.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks.

The IPAP and EPAP pressures can be set up according to blood oxygen levels and oxygen saturation to be aimed to keep above 95 %. Minimal sedation will keep the patient calm and also help to reduce further hemoptysis. Supportive measures like good nutrition and good nursing care should help to recover faster.

So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body.

I think an MRI of the knee will be helpful as in the beginning what I feel is it was left untreated and due to which it has become a chronic injury. Doing balance board training should help regain the correction of the muscle imbalance. Also, do reverse jogging and provide good core stability exercise.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

{"question": "Can getting a tattoo transmit HIV infection? I have found out that there is possible, though less likely to be infected by HIV through tattooing if done carefully and professionally with the equipment either sterilized or new. What I am anxious about is that my fiance got a tattoo done yesterday, unprofessionally (it was done by a local tattoo artist in our village who gives tattoos at the artist’s own home). My fiance had his parent's consent before he got this tattoo. But, young as we are, we are not yet aware of the risks of this unprofessional method of tattooing. This morning, my mother warned me about the risks of getting HIV through the tattoo.I am concerned because I was an eye-witness of the process, the artist just drafted the design with a pen. I saw the artist pour the ink from the bottle to a cup that has obviously been used before. I just found out today that new needles should be used, and I am troubled because I did not see the artist change the needles before he gave my fiance his tattoo. While tattooing the artist is wiping off the blood and extra ink off of my fiance’s skin with wet cotton (he just used tap water in a basin). Lastly, when the tattoo was done, he wiped Petroleum jelly over the area. Now, I am very anxious because months ago I found out that HIV and AIDS are very common in our area.These are my questions. Is it possible that my fiance might have acquired HIV through the tattoo process because of the unsterilized and reused equipment? How high is the risk of him being infected? Should I advise him to get an HIV test? And if yes, what specific type of test and when should he get the test? What other health issues are more likely acquired by my fiance after the tattoo session?", "prediction": "For further information consult a HIV AIDS specialist online -->", "reference": "I understand your concern. Firstly, stop worrying. There is a solution to your problem. It is true that unsterile needles used for tattooing can lead to the spread of certain blood-borne infections. HIV virus is quite unstable outside the human body, so it is less likely for the virus to have been active on the needles, but we cannot rule out the chance of him acquiring the infection. HIV virus does not usually show up on blood tests very soon. The best thing to do is to talk to your doctor about the exposure and your fiance can take post-exposure prophylaxis. Some medicines will be given that will help to prevent infection in people who might have been exposed to the virus. There may be a risk of other blood-borne infections like hepatitis B, hepatitis C, tuberculosis or Staphylococcus aureus. These can be prevented by taking appropriate treatment. Please talk to your doctor. I hope that helps."}

Now, it could be a number of things. The fact that it started with you starting to lift weights puts us in the direction of both a hernia or a pulled muscle. Having said that, the cramps cannot be because of a pulled muscle. If it were to be something to do with your colon, it would account for the crampy nature of the pain. Also since it is getting worse, it could be something along the lines of a colonic inflammation, a diverticulitis in an existing diverticulosis is a likely possibility. But I need to know if the pain has any relation to meal intake, like, does it get worse after one? Also, is your bowel movement normal? It could be gynecological as well but do you have any other symptoms that would suggest that? Also, it is very very important to know if your periods are regular and is there any possibility of a pregnancy? Sometimes ectopic pregnancy also presents this way. It cannot be pelvic inflammatory disease though, but an ovarian cyst is also a probability. Please let me know the details so that we can narrow down the list of possibilities and reach a diagnosis.

Did you take medicines for this? What effect did they have? 4. Is the problem only when you are with your partner? Do you masturbate? 5. I would suggest Testosterone undecanoate depot 1g injections every three months if at all, we narrow down the cause of sexual dysfunction to low testosterone levels. Alternatively, you can try testosterone gel, applied once daily over skin to let dry. By this method, you can know if it works and if it does not help, you can stop using it. Using testosterone, some people may get mood changes, anger, high hemoglobin levels, etc. but benefits are improved sexual function, weight loss, increased muscle mass and agility, reduced blood sugars, improvement in sleep problems, etc. You can answer the above questions, and I can help you better after that."}

{"question": "A 72 year old diabetic patient had heart attack with multiple blocks. Is bypass advisable? The patient is 72 years old male and moderately active. Symptoms: Initially, the patient reported moderate pain in chest and weakness. The patient was given medicine for gas. Since the symptoms continued for a couple more days, he also felt pressure and discomfort in the chest, he was referred to urgent care for cardiac evaluation. Diagnoses: 1. NSTEMI heart attack. 2. Troponin-I was 9.14. 3. Angiogram revealed a TVD (Triple Vessel Coronary Disease). 4. LAD has 80% stenosis in the ostioproximal part with 90% distal disease. 5. LCx has 95% stenosis in its mid part (nondominant). 6. LMS has a mild disease in its distal part. 7. RCA Dominant with a moderate disease in its proximal part. History: The patient does not have any history of heart disease and not ever flagged with any heart-related issue in past routine checkups. Risk factor: DM (Hba1c 8.2 ). A few months ago, Hba1c shot up to 11 / 12. Medicine was adjusted to pull it back to a reasonable range. HTN, the patient had a change in the job a couple of months ago, which added moderate stress. CKD (managed with borderline creatinine). Recommendations: CABG (Bypass surgery). Is CABG the preferred option for this case over angioplasty and stenting? What are the pros and cons of these options? We are told to perform the operation in two weeks. What is the risk of waiting longer? Assuming going with CABG, we also need to decide where to perform the procedure, in the local cardiac facility, or more reputed internal hospital within 3 to 4 hours of flight. How are the factors to consider? Is CABG a fairly common procedure with similar regimens?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Welcome to icliniq.com. Considering the blockages at multiple sites, which will require multiple stents to treat and his diabetic status says, the life of the stent is relatively shorter. CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) is a preferred option. CABG involves the major surgery where risk is higher, say around 4 % (varies from center to center), and recovery takes longer. Stenting has a lesser risk of around 1 % but with a shorter life of stents. So CABG is the first choice, but stenting is an option if you are not willing for CABG. It is better to get it done early as there is a risk of a repeated heart attack. However, the risk of such attacks is minimum with medicines but not eliminated. CABG is a fairly common procedure nowadays and considering his age, it is better to perform at a higher center. So both options are available, but CABG is preferable. I hope this helps."}

So I took a pre-marital checkup and the result was nil and non-reactive for HIV, HSV 1 AND 2, HCV, HBS, chlamydia, and syphilis. But I am worried about HPV. I did not get any warts but still, I am afraid. Are there any risk of HPV related cancers for me or my partner?", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "I have gone through your query. Presently there are no tests to confirm HPV (human papillomavirus) infection in males. Warts can develop even years after the infection is acquired, therefore it is never really possible to know whether you are infected or not unless you develop a clinically visible lesion. Since you never had any visible growths or warts on the genitalia during all these years, therefore, it is likely that you are free of infection and never even acquired it in the first instance. Regarding the risk of cancer, only certain types of HPV (e.g) HPV type 6, 11, 16, and 18 are associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer in females, and not in males. In females, PAP (Papanicolaou) smear can be performed every year to look for any atypical cells. I think you can go ahead with your marriage without any fears at this time because there is no way you can even know whether you are infected or not."}

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

Thanks in advance.", "prediction": "I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

In ECG, there is RBBB (right bundle branch block), and ECHO shows RWMA (regional wall motion abnormality) and mild LV systolic dysfunction. There is a mild cardiac dysfunction, so you should undergo coronary angiography rather than CT as there is evidence of blockages on echo. We must address those blockages to prevent further decline in heart function. Your medicines are fine, but it would be better if you can request your doctor to add beta-blockers like Metoprolol to improve the heart function. Also, your sugars are entirely uncontrolled, which has played an important role in causing these blockages. So, sugars should be well controlled. Continue to have daily walking or brisk walking. Low calorie and a low oily fatty diet. Also, you should start regular medicines like Aspirin and Statins and have it without default. So overall, it is better to go for coronary angiography. If you do not want to undergo any significant angiography then alternatively you may have CT coronary angiography which if shows abnormalities then finally will need coronary angiography.

{"question": "My brother is affected with chickenpox. Will my pregnant wife get the infection soon? My wife is 8 weeks pregnant. Two weeks back my brother got infected with chickenpox and after that, even my sister in law is infected with chickenpox. My wife has already had chicken pox in her early schooling days. I have a few questions. Is it advisable for my wife to stay in the same house as we are? Would there be a chance that a person would get infected more than once in a life with chickenpox? We performed a varicella IgG test for my wife and the report says equivocal, what does this mean? (I have attached the report). How bad and critical is it for her to get infected at this stage of pregnancy? Is there anything that could be done to protect the baby if she gets infected?", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "I have seen the report. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can understand your concern. I will answer one by one. As you told me it is 8th week I would like to tell you that in the first 12 weeks the overall risk of transmitting infection to the child and development of severe disease in child is only 0.4 percent. In your case, the mother already has protective antibodies (IgG antibodies), cutting down the risk further. But still, we do not want to risk the child whatever risk may be. So I will advise for isolation of mother or patient until all the lesions of chickenpox get crusted because after they crust, they get noninfectious. The chance of getting chickenpox again in life is a rare phenomenon but at times if the immunity is low it may occur. Equivocal in the report means that the mother has protecting immunity against chickenpox but not very strong. It would be strong if the levels were more than 12 but it is not negative. That means the mother can fight some infection. It is not very bad to get affected at this stage, but if it happens near the delivery time or within five days of delivery then it is very bad. Right now, even if she gets infected, she will develop immunity and pass on to the baby. Some antiviral drugs can be given if infected, but I do not think she requires it now. And yes definitely, until the infective stage of your brother and sister vanishes you should think of isolation."}

{"question": "What are the possible causes for urinary incontinence? I am 76 years old. I had an open radical prostatectomy about four months back. Today, I am completely incontinent. I do not smoke or drink. I do hiking and exercise daily. I also do the Kegel exercises faithfully. I have read several ways to do them and I can locate the sphincter muscle. After the surgery, besides the catheter, I had a drain tube from my chest. For the two days in the hospital, it drained at least a cup a day. On the second day, as I was leaving, the nurse took out the drain. I traveled six hours to my home. Upon arriving, I noticed that the scrotum had swollen and my penis had shrunk. By the end of the next day, it had swollen so much that I could hardly walk and if I scratched, it would bleed. I called the surgeon, and he was not concerned. The next day, I was in very much pain and could not reach the surgeon. That evening, I called my regular doctor who told me to go to ER. The next day, they did a CAT scan and found a lake at the bottom of my abdomen, but told not to worry as my scrotum would not explode. Four days later I saw the surgeon, who told me to increase the diuretic that I was using to reduce blood pressure (Hydrochlorothiazide). I increased the dose from 50 mg once a day to 150 mg. After a week, I suffered from severe cramps. My surgeon told me to eat bananas. I did and there was no change. So, he lowered the dose to 100 mg. After three weeks, the scrotum returned to normal, but my penis was shrunken from about 4 to 5 inches to less than an inch. Today, I can stop the urination with mental concentration, but the sphincter does not seem to get the signal from the bladder. My penis is now about one inch. I am socially isolated because of the smell. I cannot continue my professional speaking to promote books. My surgeon says sorry. In a year, I can be put in with an artificial sphincter. Do you think the lake in my abdomen caused the problem? Do you have any suggestions? Currently, I am taking Atenolol 50 mg, Amlodipine or Olmesartan 5 to 40 mg and Simvastatin 20 mg. The blood examination revealed all parameters within the normal limits.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "Hi, Relax and do not worry. Urinary incontinence is a major complication of radical prostatectomy. It happens in 90 percent of the patients. Your urinary incontinence is not related to the lake in the abdomen. Usually, urinary incontinence will be present till one year in almost every patient who undergoes prostate surgery. The best solution is to do the Kegels exercises properly. Your sphincter might recover by one year. Regarding the penis size also, you do not have to worry as it will recover with time. I can give you some temporary solutions so, that your quality of life becomes better and you can do your daily work. I suggest you use a penile clamp. It is an external clamp like device, which you can apply daily to prevent incontinence. It will stop the urine so that at least you get time to go to the bathroom. You can also use a condom catheter. It is also a good option as you can wear it every time and go outside so that the urine drain continues through a condom catheter into urine bag, which will be attached to your leg.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

There are a few points which I want you to know: The first and the fifth metatarsal are actually the weight-bearing bones in the foot. So, proper union of any fracture involving these two bones is important. Jones fracture involves the fifth metatarsal of the foot and that too in an area with a slightly peculiar blood supply. So, if not managed well, can lead to nonunion. You are very young, and at this stage, it is not advisable to leave any fracture unsupervised in terms of treatment. If your concerned orthopedic doctor is telling to get it pinned or open reduction and internal fixation with a screw, then it makes quite a lot of sense to actually undergo that treatment. I can actually advise you in a better manner if I can see your fresh x-ray and also your clinical picture showing the involved foot. Also, you have not mentioned the total duration since the second injury, and what form of management is being done right now. If it goes into permanent nonunion, you will keep on having foot problems from time to time in the form of pain, swelling, and difficulty in ambulation."}

Check your fasting lipid profile and do renal function test soon with electrolytes. Never miss your medicines. Do echocardiography and have a follow-up. After all, that, consult a good cardiologist so that you may be guided accordingly to reduce future risk. Coming to your complaint of having chest discomfort, I advise you do an ECG. If it is normal, then ETT (exercise tolerance test) is done in which you have to walk on a graded ramp and simultaneously your ECG and BP is recorded.

Breakthrough bleeding is also common in the first three months of usage. The body takes time to adapt and it could also be because of that. Please consult your doctor if bleeding is persistent or heavy. The big blob that you have mentioned, it would have been better had you mentioned the size. Nevertheless, I hope that you did not miss any dose in between. Missing dose increases the chance of pregnancy. If you did miss a dose, please get an ultrasound done to rule out if an abortion occured. You could also get your hemoglobin level tested as this could cause persistent bleeding. If your hemoglobin is low you need to get that corrected first. If all investigations are normal, and still the bleeding is causing discomfort you could stop using Seasonique and choose some other method of birth control. I hope this helps."}

{"question": "My daughter has perforation in right ear and doctor suggested hearing aid. Is this the right treatment? My daughter is 11 years old with a tube in her left ear and a perforation in her right ear. The doctor does not want to fix the perforated ear until the tube falls out of the left ear and is healthy for a year. In the meantime, it is suggested that a hearing aid be used until the perforation surgery. Does this sound like a normal course of action and will ear perforation surgery improve the situation?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "We shall do the ear perforation surgery only when we are sure that eustachian tube ventilation to the middle ear is normal and not hampered by any reason. The functioning of the eustachian tube is indicated by the successful falling off of the ventilation tube (the grommet). The falling off indicates that middle ear pressures are getting maintained by the natural eustachian tube. Usually, kids of this age have some remnant adenoids which causes tubal obstruction causing recurrent ear issues (like in your kid). Usually, the adenoids regress by this age. If they don't, then the kid will have symptoms of mouth breathing, snoring, teeth crowding and protrusion, and other signs of adenoid facies. If these issues are there then before we attempt ear surgery we will have to remove the adenoids (and +/- tonsils). Because the source of ear infection is adenoids (+/- tonsils). Otherwise we can wait for a while until the natural eustachian tubes function well and then we can repair the eardrum. We would need to do an adenoid x-ray to check for the adenoid size. Meanwhile, hearing aid is the best option because you cannot risk your child not hearing properly at this age as it would adversely affect his speech and development.

After it, remove and then have some icecreams or take a cube of ice, crush it and rub over the area or put on cotton and place cotton pack again after taking medicines, meal, etc., for next 3 to 4 hours. Do not spit saliva in between but swallow it as it will be blood free as blood will be absorbed in the cotton pack, will not be taken in. Talk less. Keep it cold and take soft diet for a day. Hopefully, bleeding will stop in a day. Do not use straw for juices, get it in the glass to drink, make your facial muscles rest as much as you can.

{"question": "Can a patient lead a normal life after heart valve replacement surgery? My father, who is 57 years old, was suggested to go for AVR (valve replacement). His weight is 74 kg. What are the procedures followed for valve replacement? Is there any consequence after the surgery? Can he lead a normal life after surgery? Which valve do we need to choose irrespective of cost? How many days does he need bed rest? My father has high BP, and always it ranges around 170/80.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Thanks for writing in to us. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. The valve replacement surgery is usually done using open heart surgery technique, and the surgeon connects the blood vessels to a heart-lung machine and then stops the heart. After this step, an incision is made into the aorta and using careful precision the aortic valve will get replaced. This operation is 98 percent successful. For people less than 65 years, the valve implanted is a mechanical valve, and this is because a mechanical valve will work for many years. In patients older than 65 years, a biological valve is used. He can lead a near normal healthy life. He has to follow up with his doctor regularly and be on medications for a long time. He will be in the hospital for a week and should not be on bed rest. Only thing is he must avoid physical exertion after surgery and take strict precautions for three months after surgery. The blood pressure will get controlled with medicines and doctors make it a point that operation is not risky due to that. Regular medication has to be taken and should get echocardiography as instructed by the surgeon and cardiologist."}

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

I understand that you have these complaints for a few years. It most probably is a manifestation of allergic rhinitis. The total IgE in serum is just an indication of the allergy status at the time of taking the blood sample. It is not very significant in allergy practice. Nevertheless, it shows that you have an allergy. You need some medicines to keep allergy under wraps and prevent the blockage and cold. You also need to find out which allergen is offending and causing the problems. The best way to diagnose is getting a skin prick test done at a good allergy diagnostic lab.

You would need to be taking these for about two to three months. Allergen avoidance is the best solution. Could you provide us more details about the complaints so that we can guide you better? Is the problem seasonal or perennial? Does it only occur in the nights when you lie down under the fan or any time of the day? Does it get worse in winters or when you visit any hill station?

And at what dosage?", "prediction": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

{"question": "What are the possible causes for fatigue that did not improve with TRT? I am a 42-year-old male. I had undescended testes from childhood which went untreated (hence I had always been and am on single testis only). The undescended testis still lies in the groin. I used to feel fatigued most of the times over the years, due to which I had difficulty in concentrating, focussing and managing day-to-day tasks. About a year ago, I started on TRT (testosterone replacement therapy). I used injectables (Nebido) for seven months. TRT worked very well for six months and I experienced positive results in various aspects (better focus, better memory, energetic, improved libido, was able to manage my tasks very well). After six months my hemoglobin increased from 16.6 to 18.5 and hematocrit went up from 46 to 54, and my doctor advised to donate blood. At this point, I started feeling fatigued and headache (typical high hemoglobin symptoms). I donated blood for the first time three months ago. However, after donation, I felt less energy and benefits of TRT also started fading away. Within a month, hemoglobin again went up from 16 to 17.6 and hematocrit was at 51. I went through venesection two months ago to bring it down. From then onwards, on the advice of my doctor, I switched from injectables to gel (Testogel). Hemoglobin and hematocrit again went up and I had to undergo another venesection last month. I was also low on Iron (ferritin - 46). So, I started taking a lot of oral iron supplements (ferrous sulfate - 65 mg elemental iron). I took up to eight tablets per day for three to four days. Iron levels improved (ferritin 118 ng/ml), but hemoglobin also shot up to 17.5 (as per recent report).Questions: What do you think could be the possible reasons for fatigue that I have been facing since last few months? When I started TRT it took six to seven months for hemoglobin to rise from 16.6 to 18.5 while after I gave blood in the first blood donation, hemoglobin rises by similar points in 30 to 45 days only. MCV results confirm that the size of RBC’s is increasing since I am on TRT, it means that the new RBC’s have more iron. However, I have been continuously feeling fatigued before first blood donation till now. My iron stores (ferritin) is still towards low (74) as per latest blood test and I am currently taking iron oral supplements. Do you think that the fatigue symptoms will improve once ferritin comes in the midrange (150 ish)?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I would like to know as to why you are receiving testosterone replacement therapy. I know that you have mentioned that you have one undescended testis. But many men do not have any problem even when they have a single functional testis. Testosterone replacement therapy is given only when there are both low levels of testosterone in the blood (less than 300 ng/dl) as well as symptoms of low testosterone. Your elevated hemoglobin is a direct result of the increased red cell count due to the effect of testosterone. Testosterone replacement therapy is contraindicated in people with a hematocrit of more than 50. I would suggest that you speak to your doctor and discontinue the testosterone replacement therapy for a few months and increase your ferritin levels to 100. If your symptoms improve, you need to get your treatment plan reviewed. Thank you. For more information consult a hematologist online -->"}

{"question": "How long should I wait for complete vertebral self-fusion? I have constant low back pain. The pain is radiating from the lower back to the buttocks and both legs. There is a tingling sensation after exercise and walking. Before five years, I had a bad episode of back pain with sciatica. I was told that it was a slipped disc but did not get a scan. Since then I have had odd flare-ups, but nothing serious until a month ago. Now, I was diagnosed to have a high grade 1 spondylolisthesis, and the disc as that level is almost gone. It means the bones started to fuse, although there seems to be a small gap on the scan. I was told that it would be better to let it self-fuse instead of having an operation. The exiting nerve roots are narrowed at this level, but no problem with the spinal canal itself. I was wondering how long would take for the vertebra to self-fuse? Are there any disadvantages or future problems? I am in constant pain, and my quality of life is not great because of this issue. I have tried myself keeping active, but too much activity make the pain worse. I am a police officer, and unable to do any front line duties.

{"question": "What is the treatment for sigmoid volvulus? My father recently had sigmoid volvulus. His colon was untwisted during a sigmoidoscopy. However, we understand that without surgery there is a high recurrence rate which we are concerned about. We have been told the two treatment options are A) Securing the bowel to the mesentery. B) Removing the short section of the bowel that is prone to twisting. My questions are if a short section of bowel is removed is a colostomy bag always fitted, or can it be done without one? When a colostomy is later reversed and the two sections of the colon are connected back together, does not this present the same problem of feces passing through a section of the bowel which has been operated on before it has had time to heal? So, what is the point of fitting the colostomy bag in the first place?", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "The treatment of sigmoid volvulus depends on the general health of the patient and the nature of presentation. In an elderly patient, with multiple comorbid illnesses or who are unfit for anesthesia, the preferred modality is endoscopic (colonoscopic). The recurrence rate of this has to be accepted. If the patient is fit for surgery, it can be either suture fixed or resected (The redundant segment). In an unstable patient, especially in an emergency, the chances of healing will be less. Then a stoma is opted for temporary diversion, in order to facilitate a safe anastomosis of intestine later. In relatively stable patient, an upfront primary joining of intestine ends can be done. The proper healing of the same will allow smooth passage of contents. A stoma is not always needed. It is used only when a primary anastomosis is unsafe. The present scenario: endoscopy is the safest option considering age and comorbid. Avoid constipation at any cost, as it predisposes to volvulus. Hope your queries have been cleared.

I have managed lots of cases with a matching condition and feel that you too will make good use of the information and suggestions. First, please get your stool tests done on three consecutive days. You need to wear loose undergarments made of thin cotton and dry up skin after every bath and whenever there is moisture. Use antibiotic and antifungal creams mixed in equal quantities to take care of any germs inhabiting the area. For now, no steroid creams need to be used. If you are using one, taper that off slowly till you are comfortable without one. It might lead to a temporary increase in discomfort, but it is an absolute requirement. You can have sufficient antiallergics like Levocetirizine once or twice a day to neutralize itching completely. The affected area need not be touched, and for that, the above medication helps a lot plus there is a useful contribution from one's determination too. Deworm your GI system with Albendazole or another suitable agent about which you can get advice from your physician. I am sure the problem can be managed even though it might not be possible to do so in a matter of days. The key to treatment is to let the skin heal, remove any cause of irritation, and break the cycle of itch and scratch, which is bound to have resulted in thickening of the affected skin."}

{"question": "My period is irregular after abortion. Is that due to PCOS or uterine cancer? I have been bleeding heavily for the past two days. I had large blood clots, and I soak through a sanitary pad every one to two hours. My last normal period was before five months. After that, I did not get a period for the next two months. I got a period on the third month but it only lasted for one day, and it was light. In the fourth month, my period was strange. It was a mixture of spotting, light bleeding, and moderate to heavy bleeding which lasted for 11 days. It stopped because I took a Plan B emergency contraceptive pill not because I had unprotected sex but because I read that it will stop the period. My period ended after that for three days. I had spotting before seven days which continued as a normal period after two days. From the next day of my normal period and till now, I have been bleeding very heavily and passing large clots. I had a surgical abortion last year at 13 weeks. My period came back on the very next month of my abortion. After three months, my gynecologist did a transvaginal ultrasound to check me for PCOS. The ultrasound showed that I had polycystic ovaries, but blood work showed normal hormones, so PCOS diagnosis was not confirmed. The ultrasound was otherwise normal. Before three months, my endocrinologist wanted to do a scan because she still believed I had PCOS. The scan was normal, and It just showed polycystic ovaries. She did another round of hormone testing, and my hormones were normal after which PCOS diagnosis was not confirmed. I am 5’9 in height and 270 lbs in weight. I gained over 50 lbs since last year due to depression from abortion. Now I have been reading a lot about uterine (womb or endometrial cancer), and I am worried that I might have cancer. Can uterine cancer develop that quickly?", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "I doubt that you have PCOS which is the most common cause of irregular cycle in young age like you. Secondly, it is not necessary that hormonal levels become abnormal always to make a diagnosis of PCOS. It could be a clinical diagnosis as well as based on the presence of irregular cycles and ultrasound evidence of polycystic ovaries. The main cause of heavy bleeding is that when one does not get periods regularly the lining of the womb becomes thicker and when it sheds it causes heavier and prolonged bleeding. And the thick endometrial lining is one of the risk factors for the development of endometrial cancer in later life. But it does not develop at early ages commonly. It is usually a problem of menopausal women, but PCOS is one of the risk factors for development. So it has been recommended to regularise your cycle with the help of pills to avoid heavier bleeding and regular shedding of the lining of the womb. I hope it has helped you.

{"question": "Can local anesthesia under sedation be used to decrease pain while suturing? My surgeon is recommending local anesthesia with sedation for an umbilical hernia. It is a small hernia as per the surgeon, and a small incision and perhaps 1 or 2 stitches on the abdomen will be needed to repair it and perhaps a small mesh on top if needed. I have had a terrible experience in the past with only the use of local anesthesia for a pilonidal cyst excision. I am on no medication and in great shape with no medical issues except perhaps PTSD from the pilonidal experience. Is any pain from injections to stitching felt if my umbilical hernia is done with local anesthesia with sedation?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I hope you are doing fine. Coming to your query, the efficacy of local anesthesia depends on various factors like the expertise of anesthetist, drugs used, adjuvants, the amount of drug used, etc. For a small and uncomplicated hernia, local anesthesia with sedation is a preferred technique and you can be discharged at the earliest. If you still feel pain or discomfort during the surgery, it can be converted into general anesthesia. So, you do not have to worry, just have faith in your anesthesiologist."}

If the unit is 4-6 cells/hpf counted in the semen analysis chamber, it comes to 1-1.5 million cells/mL. High pus cells in semen may indicate infection. The simplest way to check infection is to do one semen culture test. If any offending organism is found, you need to take antibiotics (according to sensitivity report) for three to six weeks. Kindly do not take antibiotics if streptococcus or staphylococcus are found, as these are mostly contaminants and rarely cause semen infection. The volume of semen is a little high. High volume increases chances of all semen coming out after intercourse, but should not be a cause of concern. Coming to your problem of infertility: For pregnancy to occur, apart from normal semen, your wife's regular ovulation and open tubes are required. Has your wife undergone any evaluation? If yes, you can get back to me with reports for further advice."}

Thanks in advance.", "prediction": "I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "My daughter has headache,blurred vision,numbness of arm and face. Is it an emergency? My 13 year old daughter complained late yesterday afternoon of a really bad headache and blurred vision with numbness in her arm. I gave her Ibuprofen, she then vomited not long after and said she felt better. This morning she woke saying that it was even worse. So, I took her to the local emergency department. Within 5 minutes of arriving, she had a numb arm, and the right side of her face was also numb. She could not talk properly. They administered Panadeine (Paracetamol+Codeine) and sent her to wait for the doctor. The feeling in her face returned, and we were called in. The nurse practitioner asked her questions, and she was not able to answer them properly. She seemed confused and trying really hard to find the words.

Please help.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I am afraid to say that the clinical history of your daughter appears to be more than just viral sinusitis. Viral sinusitis is probably an incidental finding. Abrupt onset of headache, blurring of vision, difficulty in speaking, and numbness in face and arm is very characteristic of intracranial pathology, likely a vascular etiology. She must be examined by a neurologist and must undergo a brain imaging like MRI of the brain at the earliest. Please take her to a neurologist immediately for a physical examination. This appears to be a neurological emergency. I can confidently say that viral sinusitis is not the cause of the symptoms here. Please be in follow up and keep me updated about the clinical developments. Please write a review, as it would be of help to me."}

Thanks in advance.", "prediction": "I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Usually, palpitations like these are usually benign and non-life-threatening although they may be troublesome. Considering your comorbidities, it is better to evaluate these, not just due to palpitations but also as screening cardiac test, and to rule out the possibility of cardiac arrhythmia. So, you should have a baseline ECG especially during palpitations and may need 24 hours Holter monitoring if not able to get ECG during palpitations. Also, you may alternatively use mobile-based rhythm monitors like Alivecor Kardia or other monitors. Also, you should get one echo done to look for the status of heart and its valve.

So, I do not think that your symptoms are related to these types of infections. In many cases, no cause of peripheral neuropathy is found (idiopathic peripheral neuropathy). Regarding the pain and burning sensation, I would recommend starting treatment with Pregabalin or Gabapentin. Another possible treatment option would be Duloxetine. I would also advise you to be active. Physical therapy can help improve your clinical situation. You should discuss with your doctor about the above treatment options.

Pain in the right testicle, swelling at the top of the right testicle and some redness on the urethra, especially after ejaculation. I had Chlamydia about 18 months ago. I was tested positive and treated with two antibiotic pills, which seemed to cure it. After six months, the test came back all clear. They also checked for syphilis, gonorrhea, and HIV. All came back negative. Syphilis IgG or IgM by EIA - negative, HBsAg - negative, hepatitis C antibody ELISA 3rd generation - not detected, HIV 1 and 2 ABS or P24 antigen screen - not detected, Chlamydia trachomatis DNA (PCR) - not detected, N.gonorrhoeae DNA (PCR) - not detected, Mycoplasma genitalium DNA (PCR) - not detected, Ureaplasma species DNA (PCR) - not detected, Trichomonas vaginalis DNA (PCR) - not detected, Gardnerella vaginalis DNA (PCR) - not detected and herpes simplex type I/II DNA - not detected. Six months ago, I started to experience the symptoms. When I went to the doctors, they gave me a 9-day course of Doxycycline as they suspected epididymitis. It seems to clear it up in about five days, and I was even cycling and running again. A week after the course of Doxycycline, the symptoms came back. I read on the internet that the bacteria, which can find itself in all sorts of places as the tubes in the testicles can be like a network of caves and it can be hard to kill off completely. I visited the sexual health clinic. They gave me a 14-day course of Ofloxacin, which slightly reduced the symptoms. They seemed reluctant to rerun a Doxycycline course as they said it came back after taking it the first time. Do I need a long-term course of Doxycycline to work really? I had an ultrasound scan to reveal that I had an epididymal cyst, but currently, there is no pain. The doctor advised it would cause no harm and I would have to live with it. It is about the size of a pea. Over the last few months, the epididymal cyst and redness remain on the scrotum in that area and slight rash or redness on the penis glad. The urologist put me on six weeks of Cipro, which seem to lower the irritation and symptoms by 60 %, but never really cleared it up. Then, I have had a urine culture test, and it came back with the following. Please note the following antibiotics Augmentin, Cefpodoxime and Ciprofloxacin should not be used as the first choice if alternatives are available.

So for your case, I think there is no need to worry. Just you can do follow up USG (ultrasound) after six months to look for size. Also as per your records, your BMI (body mass index) is on the higher side as per Indian standards. As obesity is also a risk factor for cholesterol polyps. Weight reduction by 4-6 kg and diet modification to reduce fat intake is desirable. Cholesterolosis of gallbladder. Follow up USG at six months. Weight reduction, low fat diet."}

{"question": "Is it a good idea to have filling material applied to receding gumline? Is having a filling material applied to the gumline where it is receding a good solution? What are the risks with such a procedure? I have receding gums on three upper teeth and three lower teeth on the left. I have no pain or problems. I have all my teeth and they are generally healthy.", "prediction": "For further information consult a dentist online -->", "reference": "I have read through your medical history and the present complaint as well. First of all, I would like you to know that receding gums is such a normal thing to happen especially at your age. You have also mentioned that there is no pain or decay in those teeth you point out. Ideally, filling procedures do not work for gum recession problems but only for decay or abrasions close to the gum lines. The reason why fillings are not recommended is that you lose normal shiny tooth surface and the bulk while the cavities are prepared and there are many chances that the filling material might show microleakage hence paving way for tooth decay. There are as such no particular risks for this kind of procedures with your medical history kept in mind.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "My teeth moved in a straight manner very quickly after wearing braces. Is it normal? I have a braces-related question.

My front four teeth shifted a lot (they are crowded, so it was a quite visible shift, some were pushed out, and some pushed back). The retainer could make a big difference in one night when I wore it, but I was advised to get a completely new brace. So a few days ago, I got a lingual brace on the front teeth (the social six). My concern now is the speed of shifting. A couple of hours after getting the braces, my teeth were significantly straighter (1 to 2 mm difference). A day after they look almost perfect, I was told I would be wearing the braces for six months to a year. How is such a drastic change possible so quickly, and is it healthy or normal?

{"question": "Please give a brief idea about drugs used for general anesthesia during septoplasty. My question is about a septoplasty operation for anesthesia. Doctor says I need this operation but I am scared of the anesthesia. Mostly scared about awareness and being paralyzed. Can someone give me a brief summary of drugs used during general anesthesia for a septoplasty? Is it possible to not be given a muscle relaxant, or paralyizng drug? If I were to be given a paralyzing drug how long would it last?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "First of all, you need not get scared about getting general anesthesia for your surgery (septoplasty). For your surgery, general anesthesia is the best option for anesthetizing you. One more point is that you need not be afraid about awareness and being paralyzed since your anesthetist will administer drugs at the correct dose which will prevent you from having awareness during surgery. While administering general anesthesia, the anesthesiologist would be administering drugs (eg. Propofol) which will first put you into a deep sleep, further he may also administer opioids (eg. Morphine) so that you would not be having pain during and after surgery. Thirdly, he would also add an inhalational agent (eg. Sevoflurane) to keep you in deep sleep (anesthesia) so that you will not be aware during the whole period of surgery. For septoplasty, administering muscle relaxants for putting an endotracheal tube into your trachea for administering anesthesia is one of the safe options for administering anesthesia. I would advise you to have less anxiety about muscle relaxants since it is best to have it for our surgery. most of the anesthesiologists are experts in using muscle relaxants for administering general anesthesia so the complications due to muscle relaxants are very less in experienced hands. There are different muscle relaxants based on their duration of action. Your anesthesiologist would be using the right muscle relaxant (usually drug will of short duration) for you. Once the surgery is over, the effect of muscle relaxant will also be over based on its duration of action.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"}
{"question": "Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD? I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS).

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy.

So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks.

{"question": "Is my daughter's ear problem neurological? My daughter has nerve hearing loss of around 50 % in left ear along with tinnitus since 10 years. She is 22 now. On the second of this month, she had put a drop of oil in the left ear. In finding herself uncomfortable, she visited an ENT, who put her on antibiotics for middle ear infection. Audiometry at that day was normal of the right ear. Next day, there was a slight discharge from the left ear. Two three days later, she had heaviness, which was fine after 2 to 3 days. During the time, she visited home, and on 12th, the heaviness of the head appeared again. So, we visited the ENT again, who extended the treatment for five more days. On 16th, she felt buzzing sound in the right ear also, and we visited another ENT. The doctor found a mild hearing loss in right ear, and immediately put her on Omnacortil 20 mg on the first day and 60 mg on the second. After that, 30 mg for three days and 20 mg for the next four days. On 17th, that is, the very next day of starting Omnacortil, audiometry was repeated, and this time, it was normal for the right ear. The doctors' observation was that probably yesterday she might not have responded properly or the medicine has covered the mild loss, but precautionary she continued with Omnacortil. The treatment is on, but she still has heaviness and slight pressure in the ear. We have consulted another ENT, who did an endoscopy and suggested that she has inflammation in the nose and Eustachian tube blockage. He started treatment for the same in addition to Omnacortil, which is on reducing dose. However, despite all, she is still feeling heaviness in the head and slight pressure in the ear. She had undergone complete blood test also, which came back normal, including thyroid, except she has a severe deficiency of vitamin D3 and B12. They were 7.93 and 173 respectively.

Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

{"question": "Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD? I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days).

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Please help.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "Yes, you can take the Primolut N tablet as advised by your gynecologist. As your periods have gotten delayed by almost more than 45 days, it is unlikely that they would come naturally, even if it does, it may not be similar to your natural menstrual pattern, this is because this is an anovulatory cycle (meaning no ovulation must have occurred in this cycle). Usually, when periods come after such a delay, it could range from spotting to scanty flow to excess flow, or sometimes prolonged bleeding which may need hormonal medications to stop the bleeding. I would like to know if you face any acne or unwanted facial hair growth problems, if so, then you must be having PCOS (even if the USG is normal). And yes, you definitely need to start treatment for your hypothyroidism as your TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level is high. Thyroid hormonal disturbance are quite common with PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), and also it can disturb the menstrual pattern too. So, definitely you need to start your thyroxine replacement medications. DHEAS (dehydroepiandrosterone) is low, so there is nothing to worry about that. As you complained about weight gain over the recent few months, it would be advisable to reduce your weight, do regular exercises, and eat a proper healthy diet. I hope this helps."}

{"question": "Is there a chance of cancer spreading faster if biopsy is done? My dad has been diagnosed with metastases and it has spread to his spines and lungs.

It looks like a metastatic prostatic carcinoma stage IV. If he has been diagnosed recently and has not yet taken any kind of hormonal treatment (antiandrogen medications), then the best treatment option for him is to go for a small surgical procedure known as orchiectomy or removal of both the testes. Dexona for short-term use has some benefits but for long-term use, it has got a lot of side effects in many patients, for example, blood sugar increase (can lead to diabetes) increased blood pressure, gastritis, insomnia, weakening of bones, muscle weakness, etc. Dexona cannot be stopped at once, it has to be tapered off slowly as per your physician's advice. For hiccups, he should take tablet Ranitidine (Aciloc) 150 mg twice daily for one week and tablet Metoclopramide (Reglan) 10 mg three times a day for three days. I want to know whether he had prostatic problems due to cancer or due to benign prostatic enlargement.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours.

{"question": "My hip pain aggravates during yoga and exercise. How to manage the pain? I am a 34-year-old male. My right hip pains when moving the leg in specific positions (best explained in a few photos). Need help in identifying what muscle or tendons are affected so I can move forward with a correct stretching. I suspect a few problems but need an expert opinion. I do not feel any pain in my daily life, and I can play tennis or squash without feeling any pain, but the problem can worsen after exercise and yoga. I have a history of not stretching, and my body is relatively tight, especially hip flexors and leg muscles. I have no history of severe hip, leg or spine injuries. To my recollection, the problem first started a few years back while running down a staircase the pain disappeared after a few weeks. Symptoms began again a few months ago while doing yoga and other exercises.

To treat them, or to at least know if they might be an issue, I would recommend getting a lacrosse ball and stretching them out. You will find a sore spot and hold it for three to five seconds. Roll off and find a new place. Do this three to four times a day. I advise against using it based on the picture and clinical description of your problem.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

And it is quite possible that due to this dependence you might be having these symptoms. Benadryl is basically a Codeine-based cough syrup, which is an antitussive agent OTC (over the counter) drug used to suppress dry cough. Codeine is a psychotropic substance which belongs to opioid group which is known for its dependence producing properties. Hence, due to long-term self-medication codeine cough syrup produces physical dependence. In the absence of it, body will crave for it and will produce withdrawal symptoms in the form of body aches, restlessness, palpitations, sweating, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, agitation, perspiration, vomiting, shivering, yawning and rarely fever with visual disturbances. Hence, in your case there is a strong possibility that you might be having withdrawal symptoms. But to confirm that, you have to tell few more details, We can conclude whether it is of opioid dependence or not from the answers given by you to the above questions. If it comes out to be opioid dependence, then we have to start with substitute treatment for opioid in the form of either Buprenorphine or Naltrexone, along with symptomatic management.

The swelling should be the reason for any tooth infection associated with the right lower back tooth region in the least case.

I say this because you have mentioned a history of swelling interferes with eating and talking. Usually, salivary gland swellings affect both the sides of the cheek region and also below the tongue with or without pain. You also got to check if you have dry mouth or dry eyes because salivary gland infections go in hand with these two symptoms in most of the cases. Mouth ulcer ointments might not work for this kind of pain. Hence, I request you to visit your nearby dentist to get a complete oral check up done. During your consultation, if tooth infection is ruled out then the suspicion would be over the salivary glands. Also, if you got any fever history please get that to the dentist's attention. Meanwhile, for pain relief please take tablet Flexon (Ibuprofen and Paracetamol) thrice daily after meals for two days. If you got any gastric irritation with this tablet please take capsule Omez D (Omeprazole delayed-release) 20 mg half an hour before food along with the after food tablet.

{"question": "Red rash on the glans keeps coming back after sex or masturbation. Please help. Over the past three months, I have been experiencing some penis problem. I have a consistent red rash on the front of my penis glans that can go away and come back daily. After sex or masturbation, the rash will get brighter and red, unraised dots (not itchy) will appear all over my glans and foreskin. They will usually disappear on their own within three to four days. My penis glans are also very dry and have a wrinkled look to it, and the foreskin can stick to the penis glans and have a 'bandaid' effect when retracting the foreskin down. However, by applying Vaseline twice a day I have noticed the dryness to subside, although the red rash will typically remain. I have been tested for STD's and have had a yeast swab test all come back negative. The doctor ruled out herpes by looking at it and said it was mild balanitis (inflammation of the glans). However, I have been washing with just warm water daily (ruling out any allergic reactions to soap) and keeping the area dry. This is more an esthetic issue than functional and it is ruining my confidence with my girlfriend. Why do I always get balanitis after sex or masturbation? The symptoms seem like yeast, but my swab test was negative. Please help.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I have noted your concern. On and off rash suggest that it is some sort of a skin condition like a noninfective balanitis, if not a yeast infection.

I also request you to kindly upload an image of the affected area so that I am able to guide you better. Regards. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"}

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

Some people who are genetically probing for allergy atopy and hypersensitivity start showing symptoms in certain cities. It is difficult to say what foods to avoid. But I can give you some ideas about it. There could be a food allergy or aeroallergy. Your place has a lot of ethnic trees and pollen-related allergy. The tests you must do are serum IgE (immunoglobulin E). If the levels are elevated that shows atopy and thereafter you will have to do a skin prick testing or blood immunoCAP testing. The latter two tests will clearly show us which substances can cause allergy in you. If you desire you may get serum IgE and one of the tests (either skin prick or blood immunoCAP) done together. Meanwhile, keep away from plants and dust. Avoid smoke. Avoid air-conditioner at home or workplace. Try to keep the temperature at an optimum level and not very cold. Drink plenty of water. Take a diary and note down whenever you eat or drink something different and if you get rashes or allergy. Keep your bed and beddings very clean. Change sheets frequently. Dust the sheets in the balcony or outside the house. Vacuum clean all crevices and corners in the house. Wash curtains frequently. Beddings, curtains, etc., be washed in warm water, soak them for two hours in warm water, about 60 degrees. These are known to harbor house dust mites. Please let us know the symptoms of your allergy-like nasal or skin. Also, let us know if the tablets recommended relieve you of the lesions. If possible take a few pictures of the skin rashes and send to me."}

{"question": "Will irregular paleo diet result in low vitamin D and B12 levels? This is for my husband. On Saturday, he had a master health check-up and a few values are not good. I would like to hear your opinion on those. He is 35 years old. His weight is 71.9 kg and height is 168 cm. The abnormal values are as follows: 1) Serum globulin 4.2 gm/dl - High (normal range 2-3.5). 2) T4 - 11.46 ug/ml - High (normal 4.6 - 10.5) whereas T3 and TSH are normal. 3) Vitamin D - 9.65 (low). 4) Serum HDL 34.9 (low) other triglycerides and LDL values are normal. 5) Vitamin B12 - 144 (low) (normal 180-914). Also, I attached his ECG where it was mentioned unconfirmed report. Please check and let me know the outcome of the report. He is an athlete who is active in a cycling race, running and swimming. But, he was out of the sport for one year and hence gained weight around 75 kg from 68 kg. Now, again he reduced 4 kg in the last three months. But he is following bad diet plans such as paleo one week, intermittent for the next week, proper balanced normal food for one week. Hence, I am really worried about his health.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I feel his low vitamin B12 levels may be linked to his paleo diet, which can be deficient in legumes, nuts (which are beneficial for the heart). He need not be so fastidious about the diet, I feel and vitamin B12 can be got from dairy products, eggs, fish, and chicken. His low Vitmain D levels are almost very prevalent in Indians, and basically this can be rectified by more outdoor activity, and if need 60,000 units of D-rise once per week for six weeks. His HDL levels are low and although his LDL (bad cholesterol levels) are also low, I would recommend daily exercise (half an hour daily) to boost HDL levels. His isolated High T4 levels, mean you need to check for a thyroid goiter and possibly do a thyroid scan, but it could also be linked to high globulin levels. Isolated high globulins need work up too, possibly disorders of immunity or rare disease like multiple myeloma (possibly consult a hematologist). I hope this helps."}

If you have large fillings (deep fillings), it can be a cause, as it is close to the nerves of the tooth. Also, if you made a new filling in less than four weeks, this could be a cause. If you have a history of teeth grinding this can be a cause. And if in a small percentage some physiologic normal tooth morphologic gaps between the enamel and the cementum tissues of the teeth sensitivity can be the cause, but the last scenario is not causing that severe pain. Also, you tried many sensitivity toothpastes, and it did not work out, I think that it is time for a dentist interference. Does your pain occur in a particular tooth or is it generalized, did you have a new dental treatment, fillings or scaling? Are you a smoker? What is your age? Do you have a teeth-grinding problem? I need more history, x-rays and some intraoral photographs for better diagnosis and for making a good treatment plan. I hope that answered your question. Decays, deep fillings, pulpal irritation, trauma, bruxism, and calculus. Panoramic, periapical x-rays, intraoral photographs. Irreversible or reversible pulpitis. Hypersensitivity. Comprehensive diagnosis and treatment plan in two weeks, a dental check-up every three months."}
{"question": "Kindly advise if I should get my tooth extracted. I had a lump approximately 3 cm away from the bottom of the tooth on the outer portion of the jaw. It was approximately 2 cm in diameter. After cleaning with salt solution, my doctor prescribed Lincomycin 500 capsules thrice daily for five days. As there was swelling on some portions of bottom jaw, he did not extract the tooth. But, he tells that he will extract the tooth as soon as the swelling subsides. He said that there is an infection in the tooth and left the tooth hole open. Subsequently, I consulted my local doctor yesterday evening. While examining and dressing my tooth and pressing the lump about one tablespoonful of pus got discharged through the upper portion of the tooth hole. This quantity had accumulated during the last five days after the last dressing. I am very much worried and nervous over the local doctor's treatment after he has spoiled the tooth by overdrilling into the jaw. Due to worry, I am spending sleepless nights. I am also highly underweight and only 40 kg. Based on the above facts, kindly advise whether I continue with the treatment and get the tooth extracted or not.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "For further information consult a dentist online -->"}

{"question": "Can HIV be transmitted through vaginal fluid during oral sex? I am a 25-year-old male. Recently, I went for a trip and ended up in engaging in sexual activity with a female sex worker. I first did a vaginal intercourse with a condom and then oral sex using the same condom (with the vaginal fluids). After 15 minutes, I got an unprotected oral sex from the worker.

Should I start the PEP medication?", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "First, protected sexual activity carries negligible risk. Protected or unprotected oral sex carries no risk as HIV transmission through oral sex is none considering she has no oral bleeding or ulcers and you have no ulcer on the penis. Shower bath will not protect from HIV and vaginal fluids in the mouth during oral sex carries no risk as these fluids will be neutralized by lipases in saliva. PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) is indicated only within 72 hours of the act and not effective after that period. You have a very negligible risk (0.01 %) of transmission considering she might be reactive."}

First of all I would suggest that instead of doing finger prick testing of blood sugar it is preferable to do laboratory test for blood sugar. Secondly, there is an inpatient (after admission to the hospital) test to check your blood sugar after fasting for a required number of hours under observation. C-peptide and proinsulin need to be measured as well. All these are inpatient tests to rule out any cause of hypoglycemia. Also, if you exercise it is expected that your blood sugar levels fall even though it is recent probably because you have improved in losing stored fat which was initially preventing this from happening. This can be improved if you eat complex carbohydrates like oatmeal, yogurt and fibrous fruits and nuts (if not allergic) before working out.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

An eccentric type of MR is actually a grade higher than what it looks.

You should be on ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and diuretics. If you have symptoms like breathlessness, these medicines will relieve that and prevent heart events too. If you have symptoms and your heart chamber size increases, then you should go for MVR (mitral valve replacement). If a prolapse is worsening, then it will not reverse.

My symptoms are breathlessness on exertion, neck constriction while walking, as well as on and off chest pain in the mornings that are unconnected with exertion. I am also suffering from severe sleep apnea. I had TMT positive 8 METs, 6.3 minutes and ST depression of 2.5 to 3 mm in inferolateral leads. I underwent coronary angiography last week. Fortunately, no significant blocks were found. Doctor said many small blocks are there, which do not restrict the flow of blood. The diagnoses are minor coronary atherosclerotic disease and systemic hypertension. The report says only minor plaques in LDA and LCX. Does this mean angiogram is negative, I mean normal? If so, are my symptoms non-cardiac in nature? Can I ignore further chest pains? Or where should I go to treat them? Am I right in thinking that this report means I am unlikely to have a heart attack at least in near future? What are the chances that these minor plaques may progress and become bigger or serious? How will I know if and when the blocks become bigger; since my stress test was already positive, false positive? Is systemic hypertension the same as high BP? My BP was only 130/80 at the hospital. My home BP machine often gives 150-160/90. How did they diagnose systemic hypertension? Being a wonderful doctor I need your help again today.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I am really thankful for your kind comments. You have always been so nice and a health conscious person. I want to assure you do not worry as everything is going to be fine soon. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. Thanks for attaching the supporting documents (attachments removed to protect patient identity) for a thorough insight on the issue. You had an unremarkable angiography. It was a very good and a bold decision to go for a timely angiography. I appreciate that you did as advised. Now at least we have got a direction to move on. Now I will reply every part of your query in the order. The report actually means that we do not need to go for angioplasty or stent placement or CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting - bypass operation) today. But it does not give any guarantee for future. You need to adapt a good lifestyle. Keep the hypertension in control. Take a good healthy diet. Do proper physical activity on a regular basis. You have to keep your lipids and cholesterol in limits too. This is the meaning of all what is written in your angiography report. If not controlled right now and not taken good care of, it may lead to enhanced and widespread coronary artery disease and may lead to blockage of vessels in the years to come. Yes, ignore the chest pains. They are nothing and will not pose any harm right away. You need to act upon my advice rather to remain healthy forever. There are least chances for a heart attack right now, but I have explained about the future consequences of the issue if not handled with care. These minor plaques may get definitely big problems if not dealt with care. Let me explain a little more about arteriosclerosis so that you may get better insight. Hypertension makes the arteries stiff and they cannot expand in case there is a need for some increased blood flow through them. No definite answer for future events as it will all depend on medical and personal care. Your blood pressure, lifestyle and diet will all be the main determinants. But if you feel unexplained weakness, tiredness, sleepiness even with a good sleep, restlessness, difficulty on exertion first and with passage of time difficulty in breathing even without exertion; it all means that, you have a bigger issue with the coronary arteries. Your stress test was not 100% false positive. It had some relevance and clinical significance. It is called early stage of coronary arteriosclerosis manifestations. Systemic hypertension is a word to differentiate it from other hypertension like portal hypertension. And, yes it means the same as you said the high blood pressure. Hypertension is one of the main causes of the coronary artery disease especially when there is no other major contributing factor. Also they have had monitored the blood pressures during the angiography and also during indoor stay in hospital. Mainstay of treatment is lifestyle modification as aforementioned. Keep away from smoking and alcohol. For further information consult a cardiologist online.--->"}

You are normal from the history you have mentioned. For a young lady, cancer is not possible, unless you have a strong family history of cancer. During periods, the follicles keep on growing slowly, along with them, the endometrium or inner lining of the uterus also thickens. Then around 12th to 16th day of periods, ovulation occurs and the egg is pushed into the tube. The remains of the follicle, which is called corpus luteum, it is the source of progesterone hormone, which further keeps the endometrium thick and spongy for a possible pregnancy. If no pregnancy, this comes out in the form of blood, bright or slightly dark red blood, for around seven days.Then it stops as the next cycle's follicles get ready. Now in your condition, all these are due to some hormone imbalance. It can be caused by your weight. The second possibility is a vaginal infection. Vaginal infection is transmitted during sex, so you and your partner have to be treated at a time, or else you will get infected again. You may have white or yellow or grayish discharge with or without itching, foul smell, pain at the beginning and late towards the end of sex. Pain will be radiating to the back, thighs. The infection will cause congestion of the glands, and they keep oozing discharge even after periods are over, which comes as pinkish discharge. You will need evaluation by a gynecologist.

{"question": "Can protected anal sex still lead to HIV? I met a man who was a foreigner. During the winter, one night we went to a restaurant in and after that we went to a bar for some drinks and then to a food store. I had not dressed appropriately for the cold weather and I had no hat or scarf and it was very cold. We ended up going to his place. Next thing, I was fingering him and we had oral sex. I started to masturbate but I am circumcised so it hurt without moisture. He gave me jerkins and I was behind him. I slipped inside him and he came off. Then we put on a condom and did anal. We did mostly cuddling. Then I pulled out the condom with no ejaculation. The next day, I developed a severe headache so I assumed it was from the alcohol. I was not drunk. The next day, I started to get burst of muscle and joint pains throughout my body mainly when I was indoors. I was caught up with my final exams so I ignored the pains. When the pain went on for some days I went to a sexual health clinic and did a full STD test. I got negative for HIV but for acute HIV I had to wait 10 days for all the results. I still had the pains and took no pills. The very next day, I had night sweat and chills. I got so worried that I went at 11 p.m. to a 24-hours pharmacy to buy painkillers. My fever went up to 104°F. I took Tylenol then get a cab at 3 a.m. to go to the ER. The fever went down and I did not see the doctor until 8 a.m. and I only got a painkiller.The next day I saw my right leg looked slightly swollen. Since then, my fever has always been low and the muscle pain and joint pain was still present. I ended up rushing to other ERs for help. Two nights ago, the pain got to me when I tried to sleep. My arms, armpits, neck, collarbone, groin, legs were all paining. I got another HIV antibody/antigen blood test just two weeks after possible exposure and it came negative. I have been taking Ibuprofen every five hours to reduce the pain but I start to get breathing problems and my bladder area feels tender with pain in the upper right abdomen. I explained to my friend all my experiences but he was firm that he is negative. We did not have bareback sex and we used a condom. I have no diarrhea, cough, fatigue or rash.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

{"question": "What are the ways to treat black spot in teeth? Just yesterday I discovered that my front tooth looks a bit black and then I decided to look behind that tooth.

Can you please consult on how to cure it without pulling out and visiting a dentist?", "prediction": "For further information consult a dentist online -->", "reference": "I understand your concern. The most common cause of black spots on tooth is cavity or tooth decay. Unfortunately, there is not any medicines or home remedy that could stop the progression or cure tooth decay. This can only be done by a dental treatment. Tooth has three layers, outer enamel, dentin and innermost never layer. When decay starts in the enamel layer, it does not show any symptoms other than visible black spot on tooth. At this stage, a simple tooth filling can be done. But if left untreated, it progress through dentin and when reaches nerve layer it starts to give out pain. This is when a simple filling cannot be done. A root canal treatment and crown procedure will be the only option to save the tooth in that stage. I can understand your situation but please visit the dentist and get a simple filling done as soon as possible to save that tooth. Treating at early stage will be a good decision financially. Meanwhile avoid stick and sugary foods and maintain a good oral hygiene to reduce the decay from rapidly progressing. I hope this helps."}

There are certain points you need to remember. Firstly, you need to have a healthy lifestyle which includes a healthy diet and regular exercises. In diet, you should eat a high-fiber diet like fruits (apple, banana, oranges), green leafy vegetables like spinach, raw cucumber, whole wheat, etc., and plenty of water, which will help your free passage of stools. Next thing, make use of morning gastrocolic reflex. Normally when one eats breakfast, one tends to get a bowel movement. So have a good breakfast and plenty of water which will give good gastrocolic reflex. Visit washroom after this reflex comes. Most importantly, effective and physiological treatment is fiber supplementation. You should have Psyllium husk 5 to 6 g with each meal and drink plenty of water after it so as to give good volume to your stools. Gradually, we can increase the dose as needed up to 10 g with each meal. If this is not effective we can try other laxatives like syrup Lactulose 15 to begin with and increased up to 30 ml at bedtime which is also quite effective. Linzess you have already been trying, Lubiprostone we can try later. But we try to avoid this as much as possible as it can lead to laxative abuse.

You may also need to do MRI of a brain to rule out any intracranial mass or an aneurysm. There is no single disease which explains all your symptoms of anisocoria, vertigo and heart disease like arrhythmia.

For this, get the following tests done - FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), estradiol and progesterone levels in blood. Hypertension - Get your BP monitored on daily basis at different times of the day and see if there is increase in levels at any point of time. This is again a reason for hot flashes, anger and weakness. It can be cured with mild medicine if found to be present. Check for your thyroid levels. Since you are overweight, there might be a possibility that you are suffering from hypothyroidism. Vitamin D3 levels - this is another reason for general weakness. Now if we go to further serious reasons, then one probability can be TIA (transient ischemic attack), there can be slight loss of blood supply to the brain which might be causing weakness in limbs. I am not sure if this would fit into you as coming to a conclusion requires medical examination which we cannot do online. I would suggest that you send us all reports as mentioned above and also go to a doctor to get full examination done. Only then we can comment on what is the right treatment in your case."}

Please suggest.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "Please send a picture of it. As you are still virgin, you can have an intact hymen (small skin tag at the entrance of the vagina). White dry appearance occurs due to candidiasis with vaginal secretions. It gives you the presentation as you explained. Check your hemoglobin. Even low hemoglobin level along with candidiasis also gives the appearance you told. You can also have a local infectious lesion, skin tag, and wart. A local examination can confirm it. In the case of candidiasis, you can use Canesten (antifungal cream) with the help of an applicator. You can use it at bedtime. If you have any other lesion or pelvic infection, you should do a swab or skin scraping and check it in the laboratory. Do CBC (complete blood count) to exclude anemia. Collect the results and discuss it with your local gynecologist or here. In case of a wart, it has to be removed with care. Due to the absence of sex, you do not know the secretions observed in sexually active lady during, before and after sex. So vaginal dryness could be obvious. Wart or skin tag like lesion occurs when there is an infection with human papillomavirus. Differentiating them on examination is necessary. I hope you have understood the suspected causes of this issue. It will become better after a local physical examination and treatment. Use lubricants when you become active. Have strict hygiene. Use soft, cotton and comfortable undergarments."}

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Upon waking up again for the second time, I realized that on the right-hand side of my throat, my gland was very swollen, yet still feel no pain. I am not aware that whether I have an infection with no cold and due to feeling no pain, no sore throat. My neck, however, is tender when touched or turning my head or facing upwards. My cheeks have been very red and I have had very short breath all day. The gland is noticeably bigger than the left, and when I look in my mouth it almost looks like there are two glands there, instead of one, on the right-hand side. The gland is noticeable and visible when just looking at my neck also, despite not being too skinny and having quite a chubby neck and face. There is only pain when touched, and only slight discomfort when swallowing food or water. My voice sounds a bit hoarse sometimes.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Lymph nodes (glands) are located in many areas all around the body, including numerous nodes in the neck and jaw area. Lymph nodes typically swell or enlarge when there is an infection close by to their drainage area as they form an important part of the bodies immune response by storing immune cells. Enlarged or painful nodes are thus often a sign that one has an infection in the area. From the symptoms, you describe some of the most likely possibilities are: 1. Tonsilitis (infection of the tonsillar glands at the back of the throat). Tonsillitis is quite common and often requires treatment with antibiotics so that the infection does not spread down the airway causing pneumonia. 2. Mumps (viral infection of the parotid gland). Mumps is most commonly caused by a virus and is treated symptomatically and monitored for complications. 3. Other bacterial or viral infection, most likely of your upper airway that might be spreading down your airway. I would strongly advise that you consult with a trusted physician so that he or she can examine you clinically and confirm or exclude any of the above and treat accordingly to prevent complications. Once treated, the glands typically return to normal within a few days."}

I can guide you more about this if you can provide me with an X-ray (OPG or IOPA. OPG will be better). Now, regarding the filling, I think it must be towards that wisdom tooth side and that is why the doctor is asking for its removal so that he can properly contour and fill the tooth.

Will my lazy eye recover to normal vision by using spectacles? How long does it take?", "prediction": "For further information consult a eye care ophthalmologist online -->", "reference": "Hi, Welcome to icliniq.com. As you have told that you have -2.5 D in the left eye but you have not mentioned refraction of the right eye. Please tell me your exact age? From how long you are using glasses? Do you patch your normal eye or have you done patching previously? Please explain the refraction of both eyes and your corrected vision with these glasses? Is there any deviation of eyes (crossed eyes or squint eyes)? What I understand from this that your right eye is 6/6 and the left eye is lazy eye due to myopia (minus glasses). So actually lazy eye is when one eye can see a clear image and the second eye cannot see clearly due to refractive error and the vision remains blurry in that eye. So vision will not develop properly if glasses are not used at an early age. The connection between the eyes and brain develop in 8-11 years of age and that is the sensitive period. The most common cause of lazy eye is the difference of refractive error between two eyes (Anisometropic amblyopia), the difference of more than one diopter can cause lazy eye (amblyopia). So the most sensitive period is 8-11 years, but in a few paper they say lazy can be improved in teens by full correction with glasses and patching of the normal eye (results are not unpredicted). So you can try full correction glasses and at day time while you are awake patch your right eye for two to six hours and use your left eye so that vision could develop in that. The success rate is less if the patching started at a late age, and amblyopia is severe. One more thing do not patch your right eye all the time because there could be reverse amblyopia due to lack of use of right eye. Studies have shown that patching for two hours and six hours have almost equal results. So patch your good eye while reading or doing some work. Consult your eye doctor for repeat refraction every three to six months. If patching does not improve the vision after six months, there are a fewer chances of further improvement."}

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

So iron deficiency anemia could be the possible cause for dizziness and headache and for that Iron tablets can be prescribed like Ferrous ascorbate. Platelet count can be high in iron deficiency anemia, post-hemorrhage, inflammation in the body, infection, etc., like secondary cause. Your physical examination should be done. Check your blood pressure and sugar level as well. Your otological ear examination also has to be done that can lead to referred headache and dizziness.

By reducing Weight you have definitely improved your fertility potential. But you have overdone it. For a height of 173 cm, ideal weight is 73 to 76 kg. A minimum weight is needed for regular periods. When you suddenly reduce too much weight, the condition called anorexia nervosa occurs. Your brain controls the hormones needed for regular periods. So, when that balance is distributed, no ovulation occurs, so no periods. The sudden weight loss may reduce your immunity too. I am not advising you to put on weight. Avoid junk food and overeating. Have lots of healthy diets, no fried items or sweets. You can have vegetarian or non-vegetarian, but not fried, no oil. Have lots of protein, egg whites, fish, nuts, sprouts, and so on. Most importantly, have lots of aerobics, exercise. Then eat more. Over time your health will improve. To have regular periods, have any of the birth control pills, once at night for 2 to 3 cycles.

{"question": "How to treat recent bout of insomnia caused due to stress? For about a few months, I have been surviving on less than an hour of sleep per night. For the first 27 years of my life, I have always had a little bit of trouble getting sleep (overactive mind), but I have never had any trouble getting a full night rest (anywhere from 6 to 9 hours). This recent bout of extreme insomnia had nothing to do with the habit (i.e.- It is not like I made the choice one night to sleep only a little bit, and then my habit got out of hand). Try though, my brain simply is unable to let me sleep normally. One day, I could not sleep at all. The next day, and the day after that, the same thing happened. I finally managed to get a decent night sleep the next day, and after that, the pattern of only being able to sleep for less than an hour (if at all) maintained itself. I struggle and struggle to sleep, and then I dream for a little bit, and then my brain kicks me out of sleep, and I cannot go back I cannot even nap. And yet, usually, my mind and body find a way of feeling rested after one measly dream. I ought to feel like a zombie, but most days I feel physically well-rested. I have heard of cases where people who used to sleep well became insomniacs after periods of great stress or depression. I am almost certain that I became an insomniac because I was nervous about starting my new job. The thing is, though, that it does not look like it is going away any time soon. Will it be permanent, how scary is that? I know the dangers of not getting enough sleep and I have tried certain things, like sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, etc. Nothing seems to work. The only thing that helps a little is 400 mg of Seroquel prescribed by my psychiatrist. However, I have such a high tolerance for sedatives that I have to stop it and reintroduce the drug after a matter of days. I guess what I am trying to say is there probably is not a solution for my extreme condition yet, as sleep and the human mind are both great mysteries. However, I would like to have an opinion as to what is going on in my mind, and how it started. I hold the theory that the stress leading up to my new job somehow fried my brain. I do not know in what sense, exactly did the sudden onset of stress somehow deplete some of the chemicals in my brain that are necessary for sleep? Or could there be another explanation or hypothesis?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "You have a unique situation and though I do not have a clear answer to your complaints, I can give you some relevant advice. The first thing to do is to evaluate your insomnia. I would suggest you use a camera to video record your sleep. You can use your phone camera with good memory capacity and place it somewhere higher, so you can see your movements at bedtime. The reason for this is that personal evaluation of one's own sleep is far from objective. I frequently come across patients who say that they cannot sleep while their partners say they do and occasionally even snore. There are phone applications like sleep as Android, etc, which record your movements in bed and can give you a reasonable estimate of your sleep time. Another possibility is that you are sleeping but not getting enough deep sleep. Deep sleep is characterized by slow waves on EEG (electroencephalography) and the feeling of having rested during sleep. That is why sleep study is the ideal investigation for sleep issues as it does an EEG recording as well as a video recording of your sleep. Sleep as android also gives a rough estimate of your deep sleep percentage during your entire sleep. In such a scenario, there are specific medications which enhance deep sleep like Pregabalin which you can ask your doctor about. Sometimes, trying too hard to sleep is counter-productive. Beliefs like I should get seven hours of sleep at any cost and if I do not, it will cause great harm to my mind and body are incorrect and very likely to impair with sleep. These irrational thoughts need to be addressed via cognitive behavioral therapy if you think this could be the problem with you. The most important component of sleep hygiene is if you cannot sleep, leave the bedroom, sit somewhere else and do stuff like reading or listening to music. This breaks the classical conditioning (association) between your bed and inability to sleep. Go to bed only when you feel sleepy. Remember that the use of electronic displays in the late evening could be a major cause of insomnia. Keep their use to minimum and use a blue light filter app on your phone after evening. Try taking natural sleep promoters like Melatonin 3-6 mg which you can find on the internet. This should give you some guidelines to investigate into your sleep and hopefully improve it."}

I had an epidural injection in the left lower back for left leg pain and two months later, I am having pain in the leg and pain in right buttocks.

Is it logical to say that once you treated the left side that something could develop on the right side? I have done my MRI spine.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "From what I understand, you had an epidural injection at the left L4-5 interspace, and two months later you developed a new pain on the right side, and you are wondering if the injection has anything to do with this new pain. Epidural injections are usually advised based on the side and location of your current radicular symptoms and the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Your physician may have suspected left L4-5 radiculopathy based on the above-mentioned findings. The effect of the medications that are injected usually lasts not more than three to four weeks. The idea is to cool down the inflammation till a time when your body can get used to the lesser space for the nerve or shrink the compressive elements with time. Since you do have a loss of disc space in L4-5, I assume your symptoms are related to spinal stenosis. Often, the symptoms begin on one side and may progress to the other side over an unpredictably long period of time. The onset of your right side pain may have been incidentally two months following your left-sided injection. I hope this helps. I will be happy to look into your MRI images to see if an epidural on your right-side L4-5 interspace may be right for you. Review MRI. Worsening spinal stenosis, L4-5 degenerative disc disease.

Thanks in advance.", "prediction": "I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "Is the red patch on the chin due to rosacea? Three months back, I started to have a small red dry patch on the skin developed on my chin.

I wear makeup for even one day the bumps start coming back all over my chin and around my mouth.

{"question": "Will dirty dollars washed along with my underwear further increase my BV infection? I apologize if this is an odd question but I am very concerned as I have been in treatment for recurrent yeast, and BV infections for over a year. Several dollar bills were accidentally washed (cold cycle, no disinfectant detergent) along with a pair of pants and a load of underwear. The money was lost in the washing machine with my underwear during the whole cycle. I did not realize this until the next day when I went to do another load of laundry because they were crumpled in a corner, so I had to worn a pair of underwear all day that had been washed in the same water as the money.

I understand your concern. But to me, the probability of contracting infection is very less. Firstly, you are not immunocompromised. Vagina is home to millions of bacteria and whether one will contract infection or not depends on immunity, which I guess is intact in you. Now, concern remained is of STD organisms, out of those candida and BV you already had. These organisms must already be present in your vagina in a low number, so the risk of acquiring this is low. Also, the probability that those dollars carrying STD organism is less because nobody will frequently touch between note and genitalia. And also these infections will usually occur with sex. Also, most of the viruses are inactivated with drying or sunlight. So overall, risk is very low and I think you should not be worried about it. I hope this helps."}

This is not the same that occurs before sexual exposure, as that is not yellow or itchy. These two feature makes infection as the source. It is usually seen as a genital or urinary infection in males, which is not always very evident. When there is a trigger like sex, it appears. As you do not have access to medications, I can only suggest you both to have a lot of water to wash away the infections in the bladder as usually both genitals and bladder get infected together. Use Vaginal washes (V Wash or Intiwash) twice a day and after every penetration into the vagina. Your husband also can use the same. These are not chemicals, and so there is no side effect. Both of you should pass urine after sex, as this will wash out infection in the bladder. If you can get some vaginal suppository of antibiotic plus antifungal, then use it for five to seven days vaginal at night. It is cruel to say to a newlywed couple, but if you can postpone penetrative sex for a few days, the problem will be solved or at least use a condom. It will prevent infection transmission. Vaginal infection is transmitted during sex, so partner is the source. Both have to be treated at a time, or else you will get infected the next time of sex. You may have white or yellow or grayish discharge with or without itching, foul smell, pain at beginning of sex due to dryness (as the lubrication will be reduced) and late towards the end, when fully erect penis touches the innermost vagina (due to inflammation of the structures around the uterus) and pain radiating to the back or thighs. Associated to infection, the bowel movement is affected, and also features of gastritis will be present. Bleeding of periods will be thicker, darker, may smell bad and more days with spotting after the periods too. Pain is throbbing even before periods and last after periods over also. Before treatment confirm that you are not pregnant. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and you both take the treatment mentioned below with consent. All these should be taken on the same day by both of you. Later you have capsule Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for one week, Vaginal wash with V-wash or similar cleanser twice a day and vaginal pessary Clingen forte or Candid-CL or Cansoft CL once at night for five nights. Your partner can have a local application of antibiotic and antifungal cream (Candid B or Candiderma or Lobate GM) on the penis twice a day after wash for seven days.

So, I will advise you to get the post done. And one kind advice is that wait at least a week before your cap is placed so that you may rule out any pain or sensitivity issues of tooth in this time period, as once cap is placed and then you start feeling some sensitivity in the root canal or any symptoms of pain then cap removal will be difficult procedure.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Is there any treatment to stop this habit?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Hi,I understand the distress you are going through. Pica can be a result of nutritional deficiency like iron deficiency anemia, zinc deficiency, etc., or can occur as part of impulse control disorder. In your case, your Hb level is low which might be the effect as well as cause of pica.Eating cement is definitely not healthy and can cause multiple gastrointestinal problems and other physical problems. Your joint pain and swelling can be due to toxic materials contained in cement being accumulated in your body.I would suggest that you seek a orthopedic consultation for evaluation of joint pain and swelling and get treated accordingly. In addition, your hemoglobin levels need to be corrected with iron, folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation.You should consult a psychiatrist as soon as possible for help in control in your behavior. In case the behavior continues even after correction of nutritional deficiencies, treatment with drugs like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (like escitalopram/ sertraline) can be helpful. More importantly, behavior therapy (habit reversal therapy specifically) will be highly recommended. Behavior therapy generally offers better results than drugs per say. It will consist of sessions which will help in controlling the impulse of eating cement or resisting it.I do hope that I was able to answer your query. Wish you all the best."}

I have never had visible calf muscles and I am a thin build. I have been active most of my life although I have never been able to build natural muscle in the bottom half of my legs. Most season of the year I get cold. My ankles and feet will stay cold and no blankets or socks can warm them up as the cold feeling is internal. In winter it becomes very painful and I become immobile because of the feeling. My ankles and feet feel like a bag of ice. I have had other problems like pinched nerves in my neck and severe tension headaches.

A bone now protrudes on the left side of my buttocks and has been painful to sit on. These problems have existed for a long time and progressed to further issues mentioned.

{"question": "I suffer from anxiety and OCD. Is it due to increase in FT3 level? I suffered from terrible anxiety and OCD that seems to come and go over time. My mother had exactly the same disorder like myself. She was diagnosed with an under active thyroid and autoimmune thyroid issue. On taking medication to sort her levels she has been free from the mental health problems. I recently started getting the issue again and took a thyroid function blood test. All levels were within range but my FT3 was slightly elevated at 8.97 pmol /L. I would love an expert opinion on if periodic FT3 level increases could be causing the anxiety, depression, and OCD issues. I am currently on Sertraline 150 mg. Coupled with my mother’s exact issue, and cure, I am not sure what these results could mean? What should my next step be and could this elevated FT3 cause my anxiety to start?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that you have sub-clinical hyperthyroidism and the FT3 here does not seem to be high enough to be causing the symptoms that you have mentioned so rest assured on that front as of now. This condition does not need any treatment as of now. This condition just needs regular follow up thyroid function tests every six weeks to three months. You must consult your psychiatrist for your anxiety and OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) issues. You can also benefit from avoiding caffeinated beverages and alcohol if at all. So as regards the thyroid function test just keep repeating it regularly. I hope this helps."}

Use ultra soft toothbrush because erosion of teeth increases more and more abrasion too. So do not use a hard toothbrush and also limit your tooth brushing up to 2 to 3 minutes only. Avoid painkillers during the pregnancy period and use desensitizing toothpaste if you feel any sensitivity."}
{"question": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available.

And at what dosage?", "prediction": "How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner-lining will fall off.

Fixed wire retainers. 2. Essix retainers (clear plastic tray like a retainer). The retainer which you have should have a passive fit after Ortho treatment. If they fit too tightly, that needs to be adjusted to bring it to a passive fit. Please get back to your orthodontist and get it adjusted. If you are uncomfortable with this retainer, you can always opt for a different type. But if you are wearing it for minor tooth alignment issues, it should be a little tight. Again, if uncomfortable, this needs certain adjustments. And do note, the retainers need to be worn for the maximum duration (as instructed by your orthodontist) for it to become comfortable. Other times, it should be stored in a container with water to prevent it from shrinking. Accidentally, if the retainer is deformed or shrunken a little, this could cause such difficulty in wearing.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "I feel something is there in throat after having food. Why? After I ate something, I am getting a feeling (maybe real) that something is stuck in my throat. I drank a lot of water, but it is still there. Why?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "1) Generally, small pieces of food stuck in the throat will dissolve on their own by being exposed to saliva from mouth. You can wait for this to happen if the symptom is not troublesome. Chewing gums or lozenges increase salivary production. 2) Since the symptom is persisting even after drinking a lot of water, try to initiate the gag reflex. To do this tickle the back of your mouth where the soft palate ends with your finger. This reverses the process of normal swallowing and helps to regurgitate food stuck in esophagus back towards the mouth. 3) If the feeling persists and if it is without any irritation or pain, it may be a false sensation called globus hystericus. This is due to the stretching effect of the muscles of the esophagus while swallowing a large bolus of food. But to confirm whether the feeling is false, you need to visit a hospital and get an endoscopy done. 4) If there is a lot of irritation or pain, you need to go to the hospital and have it removed by an endoscope. An endoscope is a long, thin camera using which doctor can see the piece of food which is stuck and remove it."}

Suboxone (Buprenorphine) is given to treat opioid dependence. Prozac is an antidepressant. I think because of your disease process, cervical radiculopathy in your case, you have been taking some pain killers mostly opioids for a long time. Doctor might have prescribed Suboxone to take you off opioid dependence. Suboxone can cause a certain amount of drowsiness and has potential to interact with many drugs to cause side effects some of which may be significant. The decision on continuing Suboxone and Prozac until the day of surgery should be taken in discussion with your surgeon and anesthesiologist. It also depends on what anesthesia they are going to use during surgery. It also depends on ur respiratory system, how well it is functioning. Your fear is that if put on opioid again post surgery, you may get addicted again. Be assured that as long as you are under medical supervision and adhere to instructions addiction potential will be less. As far as my knowledge goes they will definitely consider stopping Suboxone before surgery. Because if this is continued further analgesics prescribed post surgery may not work. Do not be scared.

{"question": "What is causing racing heartbeat and arrhythmia with swelling of legs? Elevated blood pressure first detected at age 18 (runs in family on maternal grandmother's side). Never really treated until age 72 (anesthesiologist requirement prior to cataract surgery). Lisinopril 20 mg and Amlodipine 10 mg. Continued until age 76 with doctor altering dosage and frequency as that medication gradually seemed to lose effectiveness. At that point, intermittent racing heart beat and arrhythmia began to develop, accompanied by total loss of stamina (and sometimes near-fainting and nausea) after about five minutes of any sort of physical exertion. Based on his ECG tape, PCP diagnosed that as a-fib and did a cardiologist referral. Cardiologist looked at that same tape and said it is not a-fib. Might be any one or six or seven other things, but I cannot diagnose it when it is not happening. Next time it happens, go right over to your PCP and have them do an ECG, then come back here with the tape. That did not seem to make much sense. Thinking that might have been caused by the long-term use of Amlodipine, the PCP switched medications to Verapamil 180 mg and Carvedilol 6.2 mg. Those symptoms then seemed to go away for a while. Meanwhile, I experienced a ruptured Achilles tendon, and a minor Lacunar stroke (which permanently disrupted the pressure sensitivity of the skin on my left side from head to toe.) When the racing heartbeat and arrhythmia began to return intermittently about a year ago, I then discontinued all medication. The racing condition is now more or less constant, with the arrhythmia seeming to come and go (I can observe this using a mirror to view the right-side of my neck), the lack of stamina now seemingly permanent, a slight swelling of the lower legs and feet, shortness of breath upon reclining, and chronic insomnia. I am reluctant to get involved with the PCP again, expecting the same routine, rushing in for a quick examination (they give him 11-minutes), scheduling a bunch of laboratory tests at the local hospital and maybe another referral to the cardiologist, all with the same ultimate result, since these providers, well-intentioned as they might be, are not really allowed enough time to evaluate the problem and make a studied diagnosis..", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I understand your concern and would recommend checking thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid gland dysfunction and continue taking antihypertensive medication. Regarding possible arrhythmia, I would recommend performing an ambulatory 24 to 48 hours ECG monitoring in order to investigate for possible arrhythmia. In the meantime, I would recommend continuing taking baby Aspirin and performing a lot of physiotherapies. Sertraline can help improve your situation too, as it helps increase serot onin levels."}

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks.

{"question": "How long would antibiotic therapy typically be tried? Four months before, I was diagnosed with P. acnes infection. It resulted from a shoulder stabilization 12 months earlier. I have had two surgeries for this. One to take the biopsies which diagnosed the infection and another to remove the sutures and clean out the shoulder joint. My surgeon chose to retain the three anchors against the wish of my infectious disease doctor. I have been on Penicillin for three months and my shoulder pain shows no signs of improvement. My CRP remains high, although it has been slowly coming down. The results have been 34, 30, 30 and 21. When I was first diagnosed I was told that the infection responds well to treatment, I would have a six week course of oral antibiotics and surgery, and then I would be fine. Now, three months got over and every time I see the infectious disease doctor and I just get told my CRP is not good enough and I was put on more antibiotics. I saw my surgeon again recently and he has finally accepted that the P. acnes is the cause of my pain and was not a contaminant. He is now saying that the anchors will most likely need to be removed if a prolonged course of antibiotics do not work. This is a major surgery as he will need to grind away the bone, because the anchors are tight. I will then need a bone graft as a big chunk of my glenoid will be gone. I really do not want more surgery as I have already had four in the past 18 months. I am wondering the likelihood of curing the infection with antibiotics. How long would antibiotic therapy typically be tried? And if it appears that the antibiotics are not working, then what are the implications of not having surgery or antibiotics and instead living with the infection? Other than continued shoulder pain, what are the consequences if we did not treat it? I am thinking it might just resolve on its own with time.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "For further information consult a general medicine physician online -->"}

So you should get yourself evaluated with some investigations like X-ray spine anteroposterior or lateral and may need CT scan further depending upon the X-Ray findings (gap because of vertebrae, bony density for osteoporosis, and bony spurs). You should also get vitamin D level done which is usually low in elders. It will settle in a week or two. Also, use topical anti-inflammatory medicines like Diclofenac spray or gel two times a day. You can try hot water fomentation. You need to have Calcium supplements once a day like Shelcal (Calcium carbonate with Vitamin D3).

Date should not be a concern here in the delay as the pattern had been regular till last 2 cycles. The delay can also possibly be due to hyperprolactinemia or recent onset hypothyroidism as well. Hence, I would advise you to get a thyroid profile and serum prolactin levels done as well. However, if the bleeding does not stop in next few days then you can consider opting for Progesterone pills like Meprate (Medroxyprogesterone) 10 mg once a day for next 15 days. This shall not just help control bleeding but also regulate it for this cycle. Observe the pattern for next 2 cycles and try to keep the stress levels low in next cycles.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Apply Soframycin (Framycetin) or T-bact (Mupirocin) cream twice daily and take Cefuroxime 500 mg twice daily for five days. This would heal the boils.

It can cause a headache, blurring vision, pruritis, painful extremities. One characteristics finding is aquagenic pruritis that is itching induced while bathing with hot water. It is confirmed by doing JAK2 mutation and erythropoietin levels. About 90 to 95 % of cases of PV show this mutation. All these symptoms can be seen with secondary polycythemia which can be caused by many causes. Like tumors secreting erythropoietin (EPO), smoking, heart disease, abnormal hemoglobin. So if your EPO value is high, secondary causes need to be ruled out. As you have mentioned your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), fit the diagnosis of polycythemia. But JAK2 is negative. I would advise you to get EPO values, and if they are high, a detailed search for secondary causes should be done before labeling diagnosis as polycythemia vera or primary polycythemia. As JAK2 is negative, polycythemia cases are very rare. Till then, you can take antiplatelet and periodic phlebotomy to maintain a hematocrit of 42 or below."}

Confirming NPH without typical features is difficult in your case. There are controversies regarding NPH and CSF hyperdynamic values and different researchers have come to variable conclusions. Since gait problems are most common in NPH, therefore, most researches have mentioned the importance of gait problems when confirming NPH or incontinence if gait problem is not there. Treatment with shunting might help only when NPH is confirmed. If there is no NPH then the diagnosis is likely due to neurodegenerative disorders and the symptoms can be treated by medicines.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Bathing with warm water in the evening also helps in good sleep. Avoid any activity like watching TV, reading books or playing games on the cell phone from bed. Use your bed for sleeping only.

It is common in depression to see reduced focus, reduced concentration. This is the probable reason that you are seeing problems while doing surgeries. What kind of OCD do you have? Sometimes we relate such symptoms with psychiatric conditions but there are many medical causes that should be ruled out. First are vitamin B12 and D deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency increases the risk of anxiety and obsessive thoughts. This also results in poor focus and problems in sustaining focus. So please get B12 and D levels done and if the levels are low please start taking supplements. Also get thyroid function tests done. Hypothyroidism is one of the important cause of such symptoms. If the levels come normal, then no need to get worried."}

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner-lining will fall off.

So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density.

{"question": "I noticed slight nose bleed a day after fall. Should I get it checked? Yesterday I was walking and tripped, resulting in a facial injury from concrete.

This is the area of nasal bones, their suturing with each other and their junction with the frontal bone (forehead bone). If you were to come to me, I would check for crepitus and palpate the whole area for any deformity, step change, tenderness, bubbles feeling, etc. It may be difficult for you to do on your own and arrive at right inferences. Next, what I would do is to get a CT scan of nose and sinuses. If a CT is not available or not feasible, we can go for a plain radiograph of nasal bones. However, a CT is preferred. The radiological investigation whether CT or X-ray will help us know whether there is any fracture of nasal bone or septum or orbital margins or rim and if there is any collection of fluid or inflammation. Depending on that we can tailor our treatment. If there is a Y-fracture, we correct immediately. Suppose it is more than 48 hours after sustaining the injury, then we wait for two weeks for healing to get over and then subsequently plan a rhinoplasty surgery to correct any remnant deformity. Right now there is swelling and so we cannot infer anything concrete without doing an investigation. Hence go ahead and get the investigation and we shall help you on how to go about with it. Since you are 18 years old and the nose is a prominent area of the face and very importantly concerned with the overall beauty of the face, I would suggest you go and get the tests done and follow up with us. Till then, to relieve pain Tylenol (Paracetamol) as per your weight, taken twice or thrice daily. To relieve edema take Trypsin-Chymotrypsin-Rutopside-Bromelain combination which is anti-inflammatory and helps relieve edema of the nose.

I have gone through the details and the sequence of events you mentioned and totally understand your anxiousness. See, the emergency contraceptive pills are high doses of progesterone hormone, so at times there can be withdrawal and some times there can be a delayed period too. The effects vary from a person to person. As you already had a history of irregular periods, it is difficult to predict just based on the sequence of events whether you could be pregnant or not. So a definitive test would be to check for a urine pregnancy test, preferably with an early morning urine sample. If that is negative, then you can rest assured that you are not pregnant. And you can take the medications mentioned below to get your periods and get yourself evaluated for the cause for your irregular periods. Regarding your irregular periods, I see that you are slightly overweight for your height. So mostly this could be due to PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) too that you have your irregular periods which need to be evaluated or maybe some hormonal changes in thyroid or prolactin hormones. Ultrasound abdomen and pelvis. Complete hemogram. Lipid profile. LFT (liver function test). RFT (renal function test). 75 g glucose tolerance test (fasting/ 1 hour / 2 hour).

PCOS. Tablet Meprate or Deviry 10 mg twice daily for five days and then stop. To wait for withdrawal bleed within next 7-10 days. To get blood tests done on second or third day of periods. Reduce weight. Maintain menstrual diary. Regular exercises at least one hour daily. Lifestyle and dietary modifications."}

This is were the pectoral muscle are tight and pull the shoulders forward while the muscles of the back are weak. It is a stabilization problem usually attributed to wearing the heavy vest all day. Same thing in your case. Many students who study with their head down all day or text a lot experience similar pain in their upper and middle back. If you were my patient, I would perform a chiropractic examination and recommend several home exercises as well as chiropractic adjustments. Since I am unable to confirm my suspicion, I recommend that you go see a local chiropractor for a proper examination. If they believe you are a candidate for chiropractic care, they will most likely recommend a trial of care as well as a series of home exercises to determine how you will respond to treatment."}
{"question": "I have blurred vision in my left eye. Is lasik a good option for me? I am 22 years old and I have blurred vision in my left eye. It started when I was 17-years-old. I also have an allergy in my eyes. I consulted with the doctors, and they suggested lasik surgery for me.", "prediction": "For further information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online -->", "reference": "If you have allergy problems, then you are not an ideal case for any refractive surgery procedure like Lasik (laser-assisted in situ keratomileuses). First of all, the actual cause of blurred vision is needed to be diagnosed, whether it is a refractive error or you need glasses. Then to get rid of glasses Lasik is one option. But if your cornea is affected due to allergy (allergy can affect cornea) and the clarity is changed, then Lasik might not help. So you need to get an eye examination from a specialist and then get diagnosed for the exact cause of blurred vision. You can send your prescription if you already have consulted to an eye specialist. Then we can discuss the appropriate treatment option for that cause. You are welcome for any queries."}

In the case of masturbation, we try to ejaculate as soon as possible. But in case of doing sex, we try to do sex as long as possible. So there is a psychological issue.

It is better to attempt weight reduction (if possible) before achieving pregnancy. Irregular periods, if it is between 25 and 35 days normally it does not affect the pregnancy, as such cycles are generally ovulatory. The black marks are less likely to be due to fungal infection. Those generally indicate insulin resistance in obese individuals. They may disappear slowly once you lose weight. Itching is not normal, need to check once with a gynecologist to rule out infection. Normally, foods are not known to affect the chance of pregnancy. Just do not take an overdose of nutritional supplements, as it may affect baby if you conceive. Slight rise in temperature normally occurs due to the hormonal effect and is considered normal. Slight pain after intercourse is no problem and needs no treatment. Traveling in a car or jumping does not affect pregnancy. Just do not try vigorous exercises in the first three months of pregnancy. Normally, semen leaks out after intercourse and there is nothing to worry, as what leaks out is generally plasma, sperms normally go into the uterus immediately after deposition in the vagina. Still, if you are worried, you can keep one or two pillows below your hip to keep the semen inside for the longer duration. Apart from those answers, we normally do some tests for women who are trying for pregnancy. Those are hemoglobin, random blood sugar, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), Rubella IgG (to know immunity against rubella), HIV, HBsAG (surface antigen of hepatitis B virus). You can get those done if interested. These are to safeguard your baby. I hope this helps."}

{"question": "Can decrease in semen, low WBC and alopecia in pubic area be related? I noticed a small triangular bald spot in my beard three weeks ago. It was likely alopecia areata. Saw my dermatologist last week, she said it was likely folliculitis. I have had folliculitis before in the same area and it was much different. She is the doctor. So I accepted and moved on. One small spot that has some hair growing back, small thin white hair. Yesterday, I noticed what appeared to be a bald spot in my pubic hair above the penis. When I trimmed the hair back, it revealed a quarter sized bald spot and a smaller dime sized spot. I am not sure how long they may have been there as they were somewhat masked by a longer pubic hair. So, now I have what I believe to be three spots, two below abdomen and one on beard. My concern is more of them spreading than the current spots. I am now thinking back about the annual checkup that I had with my GP six months back. I advised him that in the past year the amount of semen I produce has gone down drastically. I thought it may be a testosterone issue. He advised it was likely a result of my vasectomy the year before. Also as a part of my visit, my WBC was lower than normal, outside of the range by a couple. He was not concerned about that either. My question is whether any of these things are related: decrease in semen, low WBC, and alopecia in pubic area or all separate issues?

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks.

So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "Is Zoloft safe for heart? I have anxiety disorder from the age of 15 (will be 35 by the end of this month). I started having frequent panic attacks and debilitating anxiety after my grandmother's death. Before all this, I had been on Paxil. Six months before, my doctor switched me to Zoloft 50 mg and increased to 100mg and 150mg in the following consecutive months. I am very worried about the possible QTc prolongation and sudden cardiac death. I struggle daily to take Zoloft. I had three ECG. First one was taken before six months, the second one before a month and the third one in this month in which my QTc was 400 to 420. Is Zoloft safe? Will it cause me sudden cardiac death?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Zoloft (Sertraline) is an effective and safe SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) for managing anxiety disorder. Zoloft is generally considered a low risk for QTc (is an electrocardiogram representation of ventricular depolarization and repolarization) prolongation in healthy people. I can see that you had three ECGs in the last few months with QTc between 400 to 420 which is within normal limits. Zoloft in traditional doses (up to 200 mg daily) usually does not cause any significant increase in QTc. You are only on 150 mg once daily. So highly unlikely to have an adverse reaction. Can I ask why you are particularly worried about QTc prolongation and sudden cardiac death? Do you have any relevant risk factor like a previous heart problem or family history of arrhythmias and heart problems? Were these repeat ECGs done for any specific reason or only because of your anxiety? If you are otherwise healthy, Zoloft is generally safe. If you need any other medication for other reasons, remind your doctor that you are on Zoloft so that they can avoid prescribing medication that can potentially interact together. Also, street drugs are not advisable. Regarding your other query about Ativan (Lorazepam), you can continue gradually weaning till you are off completely. When reduced gradually chances of withdrawal effects are much lesser. It is good that you are stopping Ativan as it is not recommended for long term use. I note that you are currently in therapy. It will help to address your longstanding anxiety and develop better psychological coping strategies. It is common to experience worsening of your symptoms when you lose a loved one. Hopefully, you will recover gradually from the loss. You can also try deep breathing techniques and progressive muscular relaxation for managing stress and anxiety. I will also advise you to discuss your worry about QTc prolongation with your prescribing doctor. He will be able to monitor and advise you accordingly."}

{"question": "How to confirm whether my mental issues is due to schizophrenia or anxiety? These past few days I have been bad as I have focused back on my schizophrenia obsession. It mainly focuses on times I have been paranoid, or times I have visualized things as something else. Examples: when slacking off at work thinking, what if there are cameras in the office or internet tracking software. When having a bad intrusive thought thinking, what if someone around me can read my thoughts and thinks I am crazy. Seeing the silhouette of something really far away and imagining it is something else like a door stopper from very far away looks like the shape of a bird or a sandbag propped in the shape of a cat. These are just a couple of examples that make me fear I am paranoid/delusional or on the edge of hallucinating things. There are other ones along those same lines that pop up on random occasions that I do not necessarily believe 100% but the possibility still causes me anxiety. Then the fact that they cause me anxiety causes me even more anxious after the fact wondering if these are paranoid or delusional thoughts. I have talked to my therapist about these fears in the past but I may have left something out or not brought up these examples in clear enough detail. She does not believe I have schizophrenia. I also have talked to a psychiatrist and she told me these types of paranoid ideas may occur in anxiety or depression. I am just terrified that paranoia is not a symptom of OCD and my poor vision cannot explain the minor visual imaginings (not even hallucinations just premature constructions of shapes/outlines) and that I am not taking appropriate action to combat a much deeper mental illness. My only issue with my thoughts is that they did not occur after I started fearing schizophrenia. I have always had general anxiety. They all have happened throughout my past. After I started fearing schizophrenia I combed through my memories to try to find evidence that I am developing it. And in that rumination process, I picked out all the times I have had paranoid thoughts. Though I usually do not believe the thoughts or hold them to be true, I still get anxious at 'what if'. I am hoping that is the defining characteristic that proves they are products of anxiety and OCD versus schizophrenia. Am I schizophrenic? Could it be just anxiety? I also have an uncle who is schizophrenic and that always scares me. Does it mean I am too?", "prediction": "For further information consult a psychiatrist online -->", "reference": "Thank you for such a detailed history. It makes things very clear. I will sum up the main clinching reason why you do not have schizophrenia. You have insight. Means you know what is wrong with you and you can attribute a reasonable logical cause to this and know where to seek help. This is not the case with schizophrenics. They do not have insight into the paranoia. They will believe it is real. This is an anxiety spectrum disorder and this over inclusive repetitive thinking can also happen in OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) as well as a generalized anxiety disorder. Treatment for both essentially remains the same, only the dosages differ a little. Do not worry. This is not schizophrenia. Also, do not keep in mind that schizophrenia has a higher chance of transmission from parents. Having an uncle with schizophrenia means you just share some genetic component. Keep in mind that the same gene is responsible for schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, and depression/anxiety. So if your uncle has schizophrenia, that means you can have some sort of mental illness, either something as mild as anxiety, or as severe as schizophrenia. Please get started on SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) type of medicines in addition to your therapy. If you have not undergone some sessions of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), please do that with a clinical psychologist since it will help you manage the symptoms of anxiety. Also, please do deep breathing exercises daily four to five times a day. When you are anxious, you can do some more sessions of deep breathing until you calm down. It will reduce the panicked feeling that you have."}

{"question": "I am facing problem on back wall of throat. Kindly help. I am facing some problem in my throat for about two months now. It is something that always present in the back wall of the throat. But there is no pain but sometimes it feels in the upper esophagus, other time it feels on the back wall of the throat. My ENT doctor examined my throat and suggested me that there is no lump or anything stuck in the throat but said some redness and many little bumps on the back wall and said pharyngitis. I have done the blood test and CT of the pharynx. There was no abnormality. I was prescribed Amoxicillin and anti-fungal and antihistamine (Levocetirizine and Montelukast tablets) for 15 days. But the hidden problem persists. Most annoying is that I feel some difficulty in the throat but cannot figure it out as there is no pain and also cannot figure the exact location of the problem.

Please suggest me some other test that might be required and some medication to reduce this problem.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I have gone through your history and all the blood reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and they are all normal. Your CT (computed tomography) scan basically rules out any mass lesion in your neck or throat. The problem you are suffering from is known as globus pharyngeus which means the sensation of a lump in the throat or foreign body sensation in the throat. Most common cause for such a problem is reflux laryngopharyngitis which is a type of acidity related disorder. In this condition your gastric acid refluxes back inside your throat causing swelling, dryness, postnasal discharge (this causes a sensation of something in the back of your throat), redness, reddish lesions in the pharynx (which is known as granular pharyngitis) and feeling of lump down the throat while swallowing. Causes for such condition includes untimely food habits, stress, sleeplessness, and sometimes no cause can be identified. Taking any other medicines other than anti-reflux medications will increase your symptoms. You need to take anti-reflux medications for a minimum of three weeks to three months. Recovery is usually slow and three weeks are usually necessary to observe any significant improvement. You also need to avoid spicy food, tea, chocolate, eat regularly at fixed timings, avoid salt water gargling. Take tablet Nexpro RD (Domperidone and Esomeprazole) 40 mg two times daily before food for three weeks. If you see a significant improvement you can even continue it for up to three months.

Your aunts report suggests she has multiple noncancerous cysts i.e fibrocystic change of breast. They have categorised it through a score to show its level of malignancy. It is called BI-RADS (breast imaging reporting and data system) score, devised by American College of Radiology to standardize the breast sonography reporting universally in a more professional way. BI-RADS score 0 means benign lesions (no cancer) to BI-RADS score 5 means you have 95 % chances that this specific opacity being seen under Sonography is a cancer and you need to proceed for biopsy testing of this mass. Your aunt has score 5 mass at 11' O'clock position that means she has 95 % chances that this mass is a cancer. She also has lymph nodal thickenings (and it may be due to spread of the breast cancer to these lymph nodes in the axilla). But we have still to confirm it without doubt through biopsy of the lesion. I would advice you to go for biopsy of the left breast tissue from 11O'clock position and also a biopsy of the lymph nodes from axilla. Ask your treating physician to refer you for the same."}

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

We can take care of this. Stress can also play a vital role in hormonal functions. So try to calm and relax yourself first. See in general, an average length of the menstrual cycle that is considered normal is 28 plus minus 7 days, so any deviation either before or after is abnormal. Coming to your present menstrual history, you got early bleeding this time. This mostly suggests some hormonal disturbance which needs to be evaluated. It could be related to your thyroid hormone or even a lifestyle related problem called PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). But however any structural causes like polyps or fibroids also need to be ruled out for which ultrasound is required along with an examination by your gynecologist. Based on the past history, it appears probably you must have had an entity called endometriosis or scar endometriosis (in your cesarean scar). This usually happens under the influence of the hormones that occurs in natural menstrual cycles when you are ovulating. Right now probably you did not ovulate either because of stress or due to the hormonal changes (we need to evaluate). I am suggesting a few tests that you need to take so that we can have a look into this. Meanwhile, try to work on your lifestyle changes, do regular exercises and take adequate dietary precautions (avoid fatty or sugary or high carb junk foods). All these measures will have beneficial effects on you. Try to meditate or do yoga for relaxation. I would also like to know if you had any recent weight gain or weight loss, any excess acne development or excess facial hair growth, or scalp hair loss. Also, if you have any headaches or visual changes. It would be good if you could share the details of your recent ultrasound reports, your scar tissue biopsy report if any done, and the details of your previous issue which I am suspecting it to be endometriosis to guide you on the present problem. The reports you shared show a good hemoglobin levels. So nothing to worry in that. Ultrasound abdomen and pelvis. Complete hemogram. Lipid profile. LFT (liver function test), RFT (renal function test), 75 g glucose tolerance test. HbA1c, serum calcium, Vitamin D & B12 levels. Serum fasting and post prandial insulin levels.

Mild increase in neutrophil is present. I assume there is nothing abnormal in the peripheral smear. Peripheral smear is most important here to confirm the absence of any immature cells. Rising count sometimes signifies leukemia. However, in leukemia, the count is usually more than 100000 or less than 4000 on a 10000 scale. The absence of any immature cells virtually rules out any leukemia. Possible causes here could be stress; lipid abnormalities induced inflammation in blood vessels or liver (over weight) or mild infection somewhere, which is currently asymptomatic. Reduced MCV (mean corpuscular value) and MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin) indicate possibly early iron deficiency anemia. Iron studies can confirm or start of treatment with Ferrous Fumarate daily will help. If anemia is present with rising WBC count, a chronic inflammation cause will require evaluation. C-reactive protein levels and ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) can help in the evaluation of chronic inflammation if any.Do get a C-reactive protein, ESR study and iron studies done.

{"question": "I started having lisping problem after I got dental veneers. Do the teeth need more adjusting? I recently got six porcelain veneers across my top front teeth, and now I have a lot of difficulty in my speech. I have a slurring sound while saying 's' and 't' in particular. I always had a bit of a lisp, but now it is so much worse that I am embarrassed to talk at all because I sound so silly. I love the way the teeth look, but I am afraid that I will never be able to talk right again.

{"question": "I am taking Levofloxacin for prostatitis. Will this cause any permanent side-effect? I am a 29-year-old male. I have been complaining of symptoms of prostatitis for seven years with LUTS, fatigue, and pain as the main symptoms. The EPS shows more than 10 WBC per HPF and urine and prostatic cultures are negative. Semen culture was done twice in the last six months with the first one showing high agglutination and the second one done three months after is completely normal. I had three courses of antibiotics. Two Levofloxacin and one Ciprofloxacin with a duration of one month to six weeks each time. Antibiotics show partial improvement. I am having a relapse now with pain along the epididymis and when bending down and walking, which happened before and showed improvement only on Levofloxacin. My question is regarding the new data about the safety of Levofloxacin with reported potentially permanent muscular and CNS effects. Should I change antibiotic this time? And what about Fosfomycin?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "You are suffering from chronic prostatitis. It is very difficult to treat. Ideally, prostatic massage and EPS or semen culture must be done. But, if you have an improvement with Levofloxacin, then you can take it. The side effects are if you take it for a very long duration in years. For an acute episode as now take Levofloxacin. Then later, you can shift to oral low dose Nitrofurantoin 100 mg daily for three months. I would also like to add Doxycycline (with Levofloxacin) 100 mg bd for 14 days for an atypical organism. Fosfomycin is reserved in case you have resistance with other drugs. So do not use now."}

For more information consult a urologist online -->", "reference": "I just read your query. See, pimple and cyst are two different things. Pimple is a kind of comedo having bumpy appearance. It is usually painful and pus may or may not be present. A cyst is an encapsulated growth which can be filled with water or fluid. It can grow slowly and usually non-cancerous. Pain is sometimes present. There are fewer chances of a pimple under frenulum in the mouth. More chances of cyst are there. Cyst usually requires surgical management. It can be ruled out with the help of clinical examination only. So ideally you should visit a nearby physician so that he can examine you and treat you properly. But if you are sure that it is a pimple you can take the following treatment: Take it for 10 days and consult me after ten days regarding improvement and for further management or you can consult a nearby physician.

For breaking of these oligosaccharides, bacteria in intestines come into action and break these sugars by fermentation and as a result, produce gases in the body owing to flatulence. The pain you are experiencing could be because of that. The other reason could be phantom pain which is a pain in the part of the body which no longer exists. These are sensations origination from the nerves via spinal cord and brain. However, if you have any other symptoms, like warmth over the surgical site or fever, you may need to be evaluated for surgical site infection."}

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available.

{"question": "I am 26 years old, female who has PTSD, bipolar and major depression. I also suffer from migraines, anxiety, and insomnia. I am 26 years old, female who has PTSD, bipolar and major depression. I also suffer from migraines, anxiety and insomnia. I am on topamax 100 mg twice a day, clonapin 0.5 thrice a day as needed, Paxil 10 mg in the morning (recently started) also for the insomnia I was started on elavil 25 mg on friday but I have not taken it yet because I noticed one of the side effects could cause QT prolongation which I do not know, but I am wondering if it is the same or very similar to the side effect of seroquel (arrthythmia as a side effect). I used to take seroquel for bipolar and insomnia, it worked well for about 6 months but then I started having instances every night where I went extremely tachycardic, could not breathe, turned blue and had to be rushed to the hospital. They were calling it a panic attack for several days before they figured out if it was the seroquel and my EKG was abnormal and it was too dangerous for me to be on and I could have died. Anyhow, I do not respond to any of the sleeping pills (the benzo ones) nor the highly sedating ones like the antipsychotics or even trazadone or benadryl or vistoryl or such. I am working on getting a sleep study, so this is my last option till then. Also, I cannot see my doctor until Thursday, and I feel like part of my insomnia is because my body has become dependent on the clonapin. I am trying not to take it at all, but my chest is starting to hurt, I am getting more anxiety and more headaches. How can I start to taper down before Thursday? What is the best way? I need to get better sleep. I am starting to really suffer. It has been 3 weeks of about 10 hours of sleep each week. Also, could Paxil give me more headaches? Sorry about all the questions. I notice I have more headaches now and the topamax was recently increased to 200/day. I feel so angry, I just need a break. Please help me with some answers if you could.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I read your concerns. I feel that Topamax 200mg which works well for migraine has a little role in bipolar disorders. Studies show that monotherapy with topamax is not recommended but instead of taking topamax, you can try sodium valproate (Depakote xr 750mg at night) which will be helpful to you in both your migraine and bipolarity. Divalpoex sodium (depakote) has sedative property as a side effect. So it will be helpful to you in your insomnia. If you take 750 mg of Dep. at night then you can reduce the night dosage of clonapin and gradually increase the dosage of depakote to 1000 mg and reduce the clonapin. You can also take 500mg in morning and 1000mg at night. And I feel that if you are feeling depressed then only you should take paxil, otherwise there is no role of it in bipolar disorder. If your migraine is severe then you should take propranolol 10mg twice a day. But you have to take care about your heart, because you complained about side effects of seroquel. Propranolol is beta blocker, It is used in prophylaxis for migraine. And I feel that if you use it you finally will get relief from your migraine. I do not know whether you have ever tried non benzos like zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone. You should try that also for your sleep. I feel that, these will satisfy some of your concerns.

{"question": "Does tapering the dosage of Nexito cause relapse of anxiety? I have anxiety and panic attacks from last six years. My doctor prescribed Nexito Forte 10 mg. My doctor tapered the tablet to Nexito Plus 5 mg three years back. My questions are: Is the relapse due to decreasing the dosage? Should I increase it again?", "prediction": "For further information consult a psychiatrist online -->", "reference": "The dose of the particular drug depends upon many reasons. So, it is difficult to tell that this dose is effective or not for the particular person. Now coming back to your questions, first Nexito Plus (Escitalopram and Clonazepam) has only half of the dose compared to Nexito Forte (Escitalopram and Clonazepam). So, when tapering the dose, few persons may relapse. If you develop the symptoms of anxiety, you need to increase the dose again. And it is quite difficult to predict who is going to relapse. Secondly, as the Nexito Plus has a lower dose of the drug, it is quite prudent that it may not be effective in all persons. So, increasing the dose is a good option. Similarly, when one is tapering the dose, some symptoms may reoccur. Then one has to slow down the pace of tapering as to avoid the relapse. So, if you are stable on Nexito Plus, then no need to increase the dose, but if you have symptoms then you need to increase it. The dose is basically changed according to the response and side effects, one is tolerating. It is individually designed to meet the requirements of that particular person. Thanks and regards.

(Take a cup of lukewarm water and add 1/4th teaspoon of salt in it and do its rinses). Do not lay down straight. It will trigger up a toothache. Keep pillows a bit high or some more cushions under your neck while trying to sleep. If only painkiller Ibuprofen does not help much with pain in a day, then you must start with this antibiotic regime as soon as possible. Tablet Augmentin 625 mg BD (twice a day), tablet Gramex (generic: Metronidazole) 400 mg (twice a day), tablet Ibuprofen 600 mg (thrice a day). That is the best regime to be followed in tooth infections provided that you are not allergic to any of such medicines. Hopefully, it will help."}

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "What is your opinion regarding my medication? Three years ago, I had a stent in my LAD, which had been 96% occluded. At that time, my cardiologist put me on Plavix for a year and ongoing 81 mg Aspirin therapy. I am also taking 50 mg Atenolol. It was 25 mg until this month and was increased due to palpitations probably stress related. I was also put on 5 mg of Crestor a day. My doctor and I agreed to this, since five men in my family took statins and all had an adverse reaction. Also, two of them were hospitalized due to it. The therapy had been working and my total cholesterol dropped from pre-stent therapy total 219, HDL 140, HDL 44, triglycerides 209 to post-stent with medicine total 138, LDL 71, HDL 39 and triglycerides 141. Over the past one year, I have been doing intermittent fasting. In the past year, have further lowered my numbers to 91 total cholesterol, 48 LDL, 40 HDL, and 61 triglycerides. This latest result has been repeated twice at six months intervals. Now, my GP is skeptical about the low dose statin and wanted to put me back on a blood thinner as well. I cannot get in to see a cardiologist for a month. I am reluctant to be put back on Plavix and I am equally reluctant to change statins and increase the dose. The new GP has kept me where I am with medicines for now. What are my options? It appears with diet and the current medical regimen that I am getting excellent results. Am I mistaken? Are high dose statins required despite the good blood results? Are all statins created equal and are they interchangeable for every individual?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Good to know that you are in good control of your lipids. First of all, statins must be used when one has had any heart attack or stroke. The dose of statin is set by the level of LDL (low-density lipoprotein). LDL must be lowered to one half. In your case, Crestor (Rosuvastatin 5 mg) is doing the best. Yes, there are side effects of statins. The most common are muscle pain and weakness. In my opinion, Rosuvastatin 5 mg is the best for you because it is of very low dose. If you change to another statin (Atorvastatin), you will have to take at least 40 mg per day and that may cause side effects as these are common in your family. So, I recommend to continue Crestor 5 mg. You may be thinking that should I quit statin as my lipid levels are quite under control. Remember, the good effects of statins in case of heart attack or stroke is not only through decreasing lipid levels, but there are also many other ways statins benefit patients. So, keep up with your current treatment regimen. Keep your blood pressure under control and do regular exercise of moderate intensity for about 30 minutes a day for at least five days a week.

{"question": "Can I undergo surgery for Basal Cell Carcinoma under local anesthesia? I am 60 year old healthy female with medically controlled hypertension.

You should ask your surgeon the reason behind giving general anaesthesia in your case. Basal cell carcinoma is a locally invasive tumour with very rare chances of malignancy. The need for general anesthesia can arise when on clinical examination it was found that the tumour also involves underlying subcutaneous tissue, nerves and surrounding structures. In such cases we cannot rely upon the local anesthesia as we may have to extend the surgery. During surgery we have to remove one extra centimetre of the healthy margin to prevent recurrence of the tumour. This margin will be sent for histopathological examination later, to determine whether margins are free from tumour. If margins are involved resurgery has to be done. The size of your tumour is 2cm and may be your surgeon on examination found it to be a deep tumour. Hence to prevent resurgery, he might have advised surgery under general anesthesia. As in case of local anesthesia, sometimes it is difficult to extend the surgery especially when underlying nerves are involved. Do not worry about the general anesthesia as there are few anesthetic compounds which do not cause respiratory depression. So, inform your surgeon regarding the previous respiratory depression and get treated accordingly. For further follow up, consult a surgical oncologist online -->"}

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

To reduce BP avoid anxiety, avoid smoking (if you smoke), avoid alcohol or any other form of addiction (if you are addicted), reduce salt intake in the diet, avoid junk foods, oily foods, ghee, etc. Do regular exercise, maintain a healthy weight."}
{"question": "How does salt water gargling cure tonsillitis? How Vaporizer and Medicated Inhalant helps? Does air humidifier help with tonsillitis? How would salt water gargling cure tonsillitis?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Air humidifiers are of various types and not all of them are useful for someone suffering from tonsillitis. And also, tonsillitis requires gargling of warm water mixed with salt. Salt water gargling helps reduce pain, inflammation and infection in the throat by the following ways. Use Vaporizer or Medicated Inhalant When we suffer from rhinitis/ sinusitis/ pharyngitis, and when we perform steam inhalation it soothes the inflammed areas and gives comfort. It helps in healing and cure from the disease. A vaporizer (steam humidifier, warm mist humidifier) heats or boils water, releasing steam and moisture into the air. A medicated inhalant can also be added to the vapor to help reduce coughs. Vaporizers are more healthy than cool mist humidifiers because steam is less likely to convey mineral impurities or microorganisms from the standing water. Steam is more healthy than cool mist when one suffers from above mentioned conditions. Revert back to an ENT otolaryngologist online for further follow up -->"}

Thanks in advance.", "prediction": "I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "Can molars be pushed in the site of extracted wisdom tooth to create space for braces? I had my wisdom teeth pulled out a couple of times back, now I am putting on braces.

What I mean is most of the wisdom teeth are removed not to create space but it does not serve the purpose to chew well instead of harm the surrounding gums. And in orthodontic treatment, the molars cannot be shifted because that will collapse the whole contacts between the teeth. There is a rule that the molars have to hit each other at certain points only then it helps you in chewing your food efficiently. Hence, there is no harm in pulling out the premolars in order to gain space, because there would not be any gap left behind after the treatment is completed. So, I advise you not to panic because you are losing your premolar tooth but that is definitely going to help the treatment become a success."}

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "I have high eye pressure and glaucoma. Please advice on my reports. Please see below a report of my interactions with eye doctors in the last 21 months. This piece also includes further information under preambles, and questions, under the problem. Before two years, my optometrist advised that I see an ophthalmologist after examining the back of my eyes. He said my eye pressure was high, and I think 14 or 15. I also told him I had been seeing tiny flashes on waking up since about one month or two. The ophthalmologist, after examining me said my eye pressure was okay, I think it was 12, and he was comfortable with the back of my eyes. He asked me to do a CVF (copy attached). He said the CVF report is ok, the few black spots are nothing to worry about, they may also be false. He put me on Ivyxolotl (Betaxolol hydrochloride) and asked me to come back in six months. Last year I told the ophthalmologist that the flashes had stopped. My eyes were examined, I was asked to call in in 6 months again, and to continue using Ivyxolotl. He said I am a glaucoma suspect. The CVF was repeated. (The copy is attached). Before three months in the same hospital, a different doctor said I have glaucoma as the back of my eyes is cupped. Asked me to repeat CVF, and should continue using Ivyxollol. My eye pressure was 10.Before two months, I did the CVF test but now started to consider getting another hospitals opinion, since it appears this hospital is giving me contradictory opinions. 1st doc says I am not a glaucoma patient but gives me glaucoma meds, 2nd doc says I am a glaucoma patient. (Same hospital). Before two months I sought the opinion of another ophthalmologist in another hospital; After back- of- eyes examination and OCT, he told me, you do not have glaucoma and stop using Ivyxolotl in the meantime. Last month I woke up with a feeling that there is a shaded area in my vision. Second hospital doctor checked for retinal detachment, was convinced that was not happening, asked me to come back in three months. It is reiterated that I do not have glaucoma. Still the opinion that there is a shaded part of my vision, I saw the first doctor, who also reiterated that I am a glaucoma suspect, not a patient. He advised me to continue using Ivyxollol. Eye pressure was 12. Could not communicate to him that I would have stopped using Ivyxolotl, about two months earlier, before the session ended. A grandfather and his brother lost their visions in their old age, and two uncles have also been having problems with their visions. They are in their late 70s. A tennis ball hit me very hard on one eye about 20 years ago. I saw an ophthalmologist then and never had any problem with it since. The problem now is, 1. Not knowing what to do with Ivyxollol since I now have two differing advice from two ophthalmologists. 2. Wanting to be sure that what I feel I see from the corners of my eyes when I roll my eyes one way, and the other is normal. Is there a site, or a write-up that can take one through a total spectrum of what is normal for a perfect eye to see? 3. Wanting to know if there are other tests I should be doing now since the general advice about eye health and vision is that most problems can be prevented if detected earlier. 4. Wanting to know for sure the lifestyle steps or changes I might need to take now to enhance my eye-health at this point. What are your recommendations?", "prediction": "For further information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online -->", "reference": "Unfortunately, I was not able to see any attachments, but I understand your frustration about your diagnosis and recommendations. To start with, all the eye pressure measurements were within normal values but that might be insignificant in case they suspect normal tension glaucoma. The main problem is that suspecting glaucoma in a patient is the best way to treat it if detected before it does irreversible damage to the optic nerve. However and to suspect it, the patient must undergo a set of diagnostic tests, visual field tests, gonioscopy, and the primary test is optical coherence tomography along with measurements of the eye pressure twice a day within three days. The only way I could assist you with proper advice would be to see those tests. As for Betaxolol, I would have monitored you and your eye pressure before prescribing it. The only way to know whether it was effective is to do an OCT while using them now, stop them for three months and do another OCT for comparison."}

{"question": "I injured my knee while playing and cannot walk without crutches or bend it backward. Why? I am a 25-year-old male. I am a soccer player, and I have some wear and tear on my knees and ankles because of it, although I never had a significant injury. About a week and a half ago I injured my knee while playing soccer. My foot was not planted when I injured my knee, so I do not think it is ACL, but it has been a week and a half and my knee is not getting better. Two days after it had happened I could not walk without crutches because it hurts my knee too much, but since then I am able to walk without too much pain, only for shorter distances. I am a college student so after getting home from school my knee is very sore from the walking. I have a very limited range of motion right now as well. I can straighten my knee with some difficulty, but I cannot bend it backward. When bending it backwards, I can get it to about 90 degrees, but at that point, I have to stop because it feels like my knee is going to explode from the pressure. In the few instances where I have caught my foot on something causing my leg to bend back past 90 degrees, there is a pretty intense pain that shoots through my knee. Also, I have some minor visible swelling, but it feels like it is swollen from inside.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I will recommend that you do see your doctor as the markers of a significant injury are there, immediate pain and swelling, inability to bear weight, persisting swelling, etc. Even if we over-diagnose and nothing came out of the investigation like an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) then two things will still happen that will help you. You will be sure that the joint is fine including the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament), MCL (medial collateral ligament), etc., as MCL injury can occur in your described mechanism and you will have the confidence to return to soccer without a hitch. You will then undergo supervised physiotherapy that will help you rehabilitate better. If there is a ligament injury then that is the last thing that may lead you to give up soccer if missed. In the meantime ice the knee, give rest to it, elevate it when resting and put a compression bandage to get rid of the swelling. I suggest taking Diclofenac 75 mg twice a day after meals for a week.

If there is a fracture of the root, the treatment will vary based on the location of the fracture. If it is just displacement with the whole segment of a tooth, we can replace it back into position and splint the tooth.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Metformin can be taken at a dose up to 1000 mg twice a day (2000 mg/day). But it is ideal for you to meet your doctor so that you get a proper prescription for a clinical examination. Lifestyle changes will help you a lot. Avoid sweet food and high-calorie food (containing oil, cheese or cream). Include lots of raw vegetables in your diet. Exercise regularly.

{"question": "What to do to increase mother feeding milk? What to do to increase breast milk?", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "First of all, we have to objectively find out whether breast milk is really less than what is required for the baby as I find this to be uncommon. If the baby is active, wetting nappy at least four to six times in a day and gaining weight adequately, these are the indications of adequate breastfeeding. If this is not the case, then we can do the following. Taking a balanced diet including fresh fruits, vegetables and plenty of fluids will help your body produce enough milk. You do not have to actually drink milk to produce milk. Spending more time with your baby will help to bond and make it easy for your body to be in tune with the process of breastmilk production and feeding as well. Demand feeding, that is, feeding as and when the baby feels hungry is a universally accepted method of feeding. This is much better than regimental, that is, scheduled feeding. There are some herbal preparations in the form of tablets or powder which can be taken after consulting your doctor. In spite of all this, if the milk secretion is not sufficient, there are certain medications which we can prescribe for you. If still there is a problem, we have to explore alternate ways of feeding the baby. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"}

Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

My mother started having internal bleeding two weeks back due to Pradaxa, which she was prescribed three weeks ago. In search of this internal bleed, my mother was asked to drink a gallon of bowel flushing solution. She drank two-thirds of the solution, but was told that she had not had enough to do the colonoscopy, so the test was put off till the next day. She was asked to drink another gallon of this solution. All the barium solution caused a blockage causing her to puff up, which went unnoticed when they performed a colonoscopy. They did not find any damage to her colon, so after determining that the bleed must have been in her small intestine, they attempted to do a barium follow, in which they found a blockage just outside her stomach. The barium has now been in her stomach for three days. How long can she go like this before it becomes a serious life threatening condition? The blockage was originally a dull pain and now has gone to a sharp pain and laboratory people are still just waiting for it to pass.

{"question": "What are the pros and cons of coconut oil in health? Is coconut oil bad for the skin? A few years ago coconut oil was all the rage.

My questions are, What are the pros of using products that contain coconut oil on your skin? What are some potential cons? What skin types can benefit most from coconut oil? What skin types should stay away from it? How do you recommend using coconut oil in one's routine to reap benefits and avoid breakouts? If someone wants to use natural coconut oil on their face, what kind do you recommend using (i.e. unrefined, organic, etc.)?", "prediction": "For further information consult a dermatologist online -->", "reference": "Coconut oil is extracting traditionally from raw coconut or from dried coconut kernels. It is saturated oil and frequently used in skin, hairs or cooking purposes. This oil has health-promoting properties. It contains several fatty acids that have benefits to skin health as well. Now we will discuss some more about coconut oil step by step. Coconut oil contains several fatty acids which of them lauric acid and myristic acid are very common. These fatty acids have antimicrobial properties which help to protect the skin against harmful microns. Coconut oil also has anti-inflammatory properties. It helps to protect the skin from inflammation, contact dermatitis, eczema or other inflammatory conditions. It also helps to nourish and moisturize the skin. Coconut oil does not contain protein or carbohydrates and a trace amount of a few nutrients. The fatty acids found in coconut oil raise bad cholesterol like LDL. These are the cons of coconut oil. This oil can be used in dry skin or hairs to moisturize them. It benefits skin health but not ideal for everyone. Coconut oil could potentially clog the pores and causes black heads. Sensitive skin people should not use coconut oil. If anyone has dry skin or hairs those can apply. They can do gentle massage with this coconut oil. Coconut oil is very healthful if used externally. As it contains highly saturated fatty acids and raises bad cholesterol so those who have bad cholesterol should be avoided to use it internally. Coconut oil has a lot of benefits but one should use it after knowing its properties and their health conditions."}

Water or saliva contact right after filling. Usually half an hour gap is given after GIC filling for water contact, for eating and even for drinking water. If scaling is done right after filling by putting separating medium on filling still there can be chances of water contact through scaling procedure that causes filling to become porous and it might break. Now you can go back to dentist and ask him to do composite filling instead of GIC as it has more strength. After composite, there is no need to wait, you can have direct water contact too.

A month later, I discovered that this actually interacts with contraceptive implants, which I have been on for one year. Looking back, I have had unprotected sexual intercourse a day after taking Carbamazepine. I did get a period in January. I also took pregnancy tests in February and they all came back negative. I still feel anxious, though. Is there any chance that I am actually pregnant and I have been just having some bleeding?

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Sometimes it occurs due to gastrointestinal problems, in which eating leads to insulin gush, which lowers blood sugar and sensation like blackout, weakness, palpitations, and fatigue develop. Chances of this are very low. Please send me the ECG strip so that I may diagnose your rhythm. Blood tests that might be helpful include CBC (complete blood count), U&E (urea and electrolytes), TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and the ECG.

Only the size of the red blood cells will be smaller than normal. The only worrying aspect is the fact that your wife might have the alpha thalassemia gene which might affect your baby. The inheritance of alpha-thalassemia is complex because the condition involves two genes: HbA1 and HbA2. People have two copies of the HbA1 gene and two copies of the HbA2 gene in each cell. Each copy is called an allele. Therefore, there are four alleles that produce alpha-globin, the protein that results from these genes. For each of the two genes, one allele is inherited from a person's father, and the other is inherited from a person's mother. So each person inherits two alleles from each parent. The different types of alpha-thalassemia result from the loss of some or all of these alleles. I would suggest that you both get yourselves tested for the genes involved in alpha thalassemia genes. If both of you are carriers, your child should also be tested either through chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. For more information consult a hematologist online -->"}

{"question": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available.

And at what dosage?", "prediction": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner-lining will fall off.

{"question": "What foods to avoid in serotonin syndrome? My 39-year-old son was hospitalized for five days with serotonin syndrome. He was given intravenous and Ativan. He was discharged from the hospital and he will go to his doctor regarding his meds. The problem is he was never told if he needs to stay away from certain foods that might cause his serotonin levels to elevate. I was just reading online about foods to avoid with serotonin syndrome and after reading this I am not sure what he can eat. Sadly, the hospital did not give him any information on what he could eat. There is a list of foods that increase serotonin levels which include foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as tuna, and those high in tryptophan, an amino acid found in eggs, soy and soy beverages, turkey, eggs, pumpkin seeds, peanuts and peanut butter, chicken and cheeses. A diet rich in folate may also contribute to increased serotonin levels. Some foods rich in folate include leafy green vegetables, beans, legumes, nuts, bread, and cereals. It sounds like there really is nothing he can eat without worrying about causing any additional problems. After reading all this, what can he eat? This is extremely scary as I have no clue about what he can and cannot eat.

Mode of transmission would be unprotected homosexual, heterosexual contact with an infected partner and very close physical contact. It can spread from hand to hand contact as well, and from infected mother to the child as well in-utero. The treatment includes treating both gonorrhea and chlamydia, as they are usually transmitted together. For gonorrhea, Cipro XR (Ciprofloxacin extended-release) 500 mg single dose, or Levaquin (Levofloxacin) 500 mg single dose, or Tequin (Gatifloxacin) 400 mg single dose. For chlamydia, Doxycycline 100 mg two to three times a day for 10–14 days, or Zithromax (Azithromycin) 1.0 g single dose, or Zithromax or Z-pak (Azithromycin) 500mg on day 1, followed by one tablet (250 mg) once a day for four more days.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Constantly irritated gums become weak and starts to bleed when we brush or in the morning time after waking up. A professional scaling and polishing procedure is done by an ultrasonic scaler instrument to remove that calculus. Once removed, the gums take a day to heal and the gum bleeding will stop the next morning. Please visit your dentist and get this procedure done. This procedure can be done once in 6 months if required. Although we do a proper brushing every day, there are certain spots between teeth where the bristles fail to reach.

The second question, I see in him the same thing when I was young and also he is bedwetting when he is not well or very tired, he gets deeply sleep, but when he wakes up he is fine.

So do not worry about that. Also as regards to bedwetting, make it a point for the child to empty the bladder before going to bed. Also, you can wake up the child in the middle of the night if you find out that he has bedwetted himself so that this develops a behavioral change in the child and eventually will go a long way in stopping bed wetting. Another technique that can be used is a bedwetting alarm which sounds when the bed becomes wet and wakes the child up. This can also help in reducing the instances of bedwetting. In extreme cases, we use vasopressin to reduce bed wetting. Also, bedwetting beyond the age of 5 years is not acceptable. Hence, follow the above mentioned advise and observe the changes in your child. For more information consult a paediatrician online -->"}

I used Flixonase twice daily for about 10 days. At this point I am not sick and inflammation has gone. I do not take any medication and I am healthy. The opthalmologist did a visual check and told me that I he could not see any sign of swelling, it was a very superficial check, just look up with the light. I will describe how I feel my hyposmia: I do not have a total loss of smell. I can smell some things slightly, other things very slightly, and other things I cannot smell at all. I have noticed that sometimes, more or less one time at every two days, I can recover a lot of my smell sense for a short time, sometimes 30 minutes to an hour followed with worsening of my smell sense. As for example, yesterday I could smell and taste my lunch and I could smell many others things like the rain outside the house. Sometimes I have worsening of my hyposmia and when it occurs I cannot smell many things. After a while I recover some of my smell sense more or less to the level before (not the normal level). Last night, my smell sense got worse but stabilized overnight. This morning it again got worse. The same is happening with the intensity of odors, it improves and worsens along the day.

{"question": "I am hearing a strange noise only at night. Please help. Around three months back, I started to hear a strange noise at night. We live in a village. Apart from the odd barking dog and passing car, it is silent, especially at night. However, I started to hear what sounded like a distant engine, but it never got any closer. It is almost like a droning sound, not a hum as such as seemed to almost vibrating through me. It did not particularly stop me sleeping, but was annoying. It was there for a couple of nights and I would go outside and could not hear it. I could hear it in other rooms of the house, although maybe not as loud as the bedroom. I could find no real explanation for it. Electric cables are going to the house but have been the same for years, and nothing has changed. Then a couple of weeks later, the noise was back and was really loud when I went to bed. I fell asleep but woke in the middle of the night, and it kept me awake. The next day I could still hear it everywhere in the house, also in the next door house, but not so much outside. It is like a constant distant aircraft noise or car engine that goes in and out, louder, quieter, louder, quieter and at times I almost feel it than hear it. It left me tired with a slight headache, and it was just pulsating through my body all the time. That was the worst day. Since then we moved to another house in an entirely different area, although still a quiet village location. There is a very little passing traffic as we are at the end of a lane. At first the noise seemed to have gone; however, I have begun to notice it again. I can hear it all the time, but in the day there are other noises and distractions. It is at night when it is very quiet I can hear a constant drone. It now seems mainly in my left ear, or I can hear it especially in that ear. If I put my finger in that ear, it stops. Also if I hold my nose and blow and keep the pressure up the noise cannot be heard. If I put my finger in my right ear, I can still hear it, although maybe not as loudly. For example, it was very distant this morning. If I put my left ear on the pillow and lie on my side, I can hear it just the same. It does not keep me awake and or cause me any real problems. I am just getting concerned it could be due to something nasty, like a brain tumour or something. I went to the pharmacist and got some cleaning spray. I have also had a consultation with an ENT specialist. I did not explain to him about the droning sound as it is difficult in another language, but he gave me a checkup and did not find anything out of the ordinary by looking in my ears, nose, throat, etc. I have recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism although I can get no connection. If it is tinnitus, then I can live with it quickly enough at the moment. But, I am concerned that it could be the symptom of any serious underlying problem. I have had recent blood tests done, and they were all fine apart from my TSH levels for hypothyroidism, and my blood pressure is fine.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Revert with the reports to an ENT otolaryngologist online -->"}

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Hope you and your dear ones are safe and healthy. From your history, I gather that you have two problems. Delayed period and lower abdominal pain and cramps. For the delayed period, I see your body weight could be a reason. With a height of 152 cm, your expected weight is 52-55 kg. The extra fat, cholesterol can get converted into hormones and cause an imbalance of hormones needed for normal ovulation. Thus due to impaired ovulation, period will be delayed on and off. At present to have period, take any of the birth control pills, packet of 21 pills (ones used for contraception) twice daily for 10 days. No matter what the reason is, you will have periods within 7-10 days after the last pill. Through good dieting, not fasting, and proper work out reduce your weight. Weight loss of just 5 kg is enough to correct hormone imbalance. About pain in the lower abdominal area and during sex, there could be two reasons. a. Pelvic infection in and around the uterus. Infections enter with semen. Symptoms are vaginal dryness during sex, burning sensation in vagina after sex, pain throughout which increases around the time of ejaculation, following day excessive vaginal discharge with or without itching and foul smell. Similar discharge just before period. Period blood is darker, thicker and stickier. Mild feverish feel before period. Cramping pains just before period. If this is the case, avoid sex, meet your doctor at leisure, both you and your partner should have a good course of antibiotics. It will get fully resolved. b. Endometriosis due to blood causing adhesive areas around uterus, increasing over the months and years. But I do not think you could be having this. Both these need medical help. You can solve the issue of period with the pills. I hope this helps."}

{"question": "Is surgery necessary for a mild benign prostatic hyperplasia? I am a 58 year old male. Except for low blood pressure, I am in generally perfect health with mild benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) that has not been getting noticeably worse lately but, has been present for years. While my stream is certainly not like when I was younger, I have no difficulty in voiding other than it takes more time and I do not have to urinate frequently (considering the amount of liquid intake). The stream is enhanced to relatively normal with low-dose saw palmetto and 5 mg Tadalafil. I do drink plenty of water. On following a dietary shift away from red and white meat (still consuming fish and eggs) with plenty of fruits and vegetables, I began producing sand in my urine which prompted me to see a urologist. The urologist insists this condition is caused by excessive urinary retention due to BPH. On my volition, I had the sand analyzed to determine it was 100 % carbonate apatite, which I know from basic chemistry, precipitates in alkaline pH. With a pH meter, I learned my urine was often 8+ which I have corrected with dietary changes (based on PRAL score) and L-methionine if needed and monitor throughout the day to keep it mildly acidic. This has alleviated the stone formation. A digital exam at the routine physicals with multiple doctors has elicited no concerns, stating either no or mild enlargement felt. However, CT scan reportedly reveals lateral enlargement. Multiple ultrasounds show that my bladder retention currently is not excessive (9 to 30 cc) but, a recent UroCuff test indicates a bladder pressure of 260\" H20 (with the meds mentioned above) with no accompanying abdominal muscle activity (no pushing). My flow is quite good with what I am presently taking, something I would characterize as pretty normal for a healthy adult male. It is just that apparently to achieve that flow my bladder is quite muscular. I do not feel like I am straining at all when voiding, just relaxed. The urologist insists that a prostate surgery (microwave) is needed to correct the BPH and alleviate the higher than normal bladder pressure and he thinks I will still have future stone formation if it is not corrected. He says that an elevated bladder pressure is damaging on the bladder. He states he is supported by cystoscopy that reveals pronounced striations on the interior wall, which for all I know are rugae. He characterized it as visually the bladder of an 80 year old. I do not wish to subject myself to unnecessary surgery with all its associated risks and side effects. What is the risk, (if any) associated with elevated bladder pressure? Is surgery really warranted considering the present lack of significant impact on my lifestyle? My main concern is, in the case of no perceived functional problems, is the elevated bladder pressure actually harmful to the bladder or kidneys? Or is it just like any other muscle that simply develops in response to use and is harmless compensation.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "I have gone through your history.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

{"question": "My kid's pulpectomy could not be completed as she was screaming. Will it bleed? My daughter underwent a root canal. She is 4. The dentist tried to do it with gas and numbing it. She sat well through the drilling, then when he was doing the pulpectomy, she screamed and choked and flailed around. The dentist seemed unable to handle it all and he said she had a hyperemic pulp. He said he could not stop the bleeding. He was worried for my daughter from the crying and choking. So, he put a temporary filling over it and stopped. He said he was concerned it may bleed and cause pressure inside the molar. Pain and or abscess or infection. I follow up with him in one week just to check it out. Is this something I should be concerned with or is it common? It sounds very scary that her tooth could be bleeding from inside. I am just wondering if I need a second opinion, she needs to see her pediatrician or what. I am nervous. Is this a common thing or do I need a new pediatric dentist?", "prediction": "For further information consult a dentist online -->", "reference": "It is normal for the pulp to bleed profusely when it is a little enlarged inside, like a polyp. The dentist could have easily managed her, had he given a local anesthesia (just a drop would have numbed it) directly inside the pulp when doing the root canal treatment. He could have then removed the pulp polyp and done the remainder. As soon as the pulp polyp is scraped away, the bleeding would have stopped instantly. Do not worry. In the next appointment, he may do it. Anyway, the bleeding is nothing to worry about, as it will not cause any severe pain now due to pressure. But, next time, when he opens it, ask him to put local anesthesia drop inside or inject it directly inside (all this after giving inhalation gas), and then do the procedure.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

Right now, since you have pain, do lukewarm salt water gargling to help with the gum inflammation healing. For severe pain you can take Ibuprufen 400 mg thrice daily after food for three days.

It is generally due to past negative experiences in life as you mentioned about the early sexual interactions with the same gender partners. Since your first early interactions were with the same gender, it usually becomes a habit or the sexual preference/ orientation. Are you currently engaged in homosexual activities? It becomes difficult to alter your sexual preference if you are engaged in sexual activities with the same sex. Since you are highly motivated to make changes in your sexual preferences, it is the first step towards betterment. Intentionally involve yourself in activities which would help you find interest in opposite gender. For example, Intentionally avoid sexual interaction with the same gender so that your sexual needs find satisfaction with the opposite gender. You may feel disturbed as you do it. Learn to deal with your emotions and state of mind. Suggest positive affirmations for you at the time of disturbance such as I am doing it because I want a straight man's life, I choose to be sexually attracted towards girls, and I like to be a heterosexual (opposite sex) partner. These are instances from what you have already mentioned. Find more positive affirmations for you which will help you become what you want. Make these affirmations a routine in your self-talk. Practicing it daily will gradually make it automatic in your mind, and your brain will start working on the way you want it to be. I hope this is helpful for you. Best Regards.

So calm down now and give relief to yourself. Your periods have reduced due to the effect of Nexplanon as it is a contraceptive as well as it also reduces blood loss during periods and some women get reduced bleeding or absent bleeding in the very start of the implantation. Your periods will slowly return to normal. So do not have to worry about pregnancy now. And secondly all of the symptoms you told are pointing towards anxiety, and you need some stress reliever. The problem with passing stools may be due to the lack of fiber in your diet. You must drink plenty of water and increase the intake of fiber by eating more vegetables, and less junk food will help improve your bowels, and hopefully, this issue will be resolved soon.

{"question": "What are the preventive measures in case of slippage or breakage of condoms? I am a 37 year old heterosexual male. I am HIV negative with no known STD. I always have safe sex. I always have very safe sex with girls who are not sex workers. But may have casual sex with others. Generally, I would imagine that they too would be practicing safe sex with their regular boyfriends, then really I do not see statistically being any real chance of contracting HIV or any other STD. I too have had casual sex with a number of such girls. If I continue these activities with multiple partners of the same profile then chance of contracting HIV or STDs should be next to zero. Is this correct? In two situations like condom coming out or breaking, but the sex act being stopped immediately, what would be the chance of my contracting HIV or any other STD? What other immediate preventive measure should I take if the condom breaks or comes out other than stopping the act? Should I take Truvada immediately? If yes, for how many days should I take it to become effective? Does it become effective from day one? Can one take it few days before sexual intercourse and stop it in between and again restart it? Do I need to do any blood test for HIV or other STDs in case the condom breaks or slips out? If so, what are the blood tests that I need to do and with how many days gap? Is there any STD one can get from skin to skin contact without genital contact. Is there any STD one can get from accidental genital contact and what preventive measures should be taken if this happens? Can one get an STD from kissing?

My penis is 7 inches in length and 7.5 inches in girth. Do I use XL or XXL? I do not find any condom which supports 7.5 inch girth. What should I do in this case? It seems that if the partner is HIV+ then it would be a statistically low probability that with one sex act with protection? Would it not be better to take Truvada regularly to be on the safer side?

As you mentioned that the status of your partners are mostly not known, so this puts you in risk of contracting STD or HIV if you get involved in unsafe sexual practices with such partners. In case of slippage of condoms or breakage of condoms, puts you at risk, which cannot be neglected while having sexual intercourse. First and foremost important thing to do is, to stop the act and wash your genitals with mild soap under running water. Avoid applying any cream or lubricant that can cause irritation to genital skin. Besides this avoid promiscuous behavior. There is no need to take Truvada (Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate) until and unless you know the HIV status of the partner with whom you have had unprotected sex. Viral infections such as genital warts and herpes can be contracted by even skin to skin contact. For accidental genital contact, firstly get the STD profile done, and then if required start the treatment for the respective STD that is detected on testing. In your case you should use XL size condoms (extra large), which can be procured from a medical store. Having an unprotected sexual intercourse with a partner who is HIV+ then there is always a risk of contracting HIV, you cannot neglect it or can take chance of not contracting HIV by having sex only for once with such person. If you are not sure about vaccination and as you are involved in unhealthy sexual practices then you should get your hepatitis B done. For further clarification consult a sexologist online -->"}

{"question": "Do the tests performed confirm that I have not contracted HIV? I want to tell my case and I would appreciate a detailed answer on this subject. About five months ago, I had sex with a CSW during a vacation. The relationship included oral sex and vaginal sex. The relationship was completely protected (also oral) and I put on a condom (I do not know if it got broken). After two days of the incident, I noticed a small red bloodbath on my scrotum, which later grew (the skin doctor diagnosed it as an angerectomy). After about two weeks after the incident, I began to have severe pain in the legs and feet that have gone and are still coming today randomly. In addition, 10 days after the incident, my temperature rose to 37.5 for about a month and a half. After a month or so, I started to get a lot of wounds in my chest, shoulders, and back (the dermatologist diagnosed it as a folliculitis). These wounds are coming and going today. In addition, many small red dots (about 50 to 60) have begun to appear on the skin especially in the chest and arms to this day, more and more news appears (the skin doctor claimed to be hemangiomas). It looks like a little blood blister. Also, I suffer from severe dehydration in the skin and palms for a long period of three months, there is really a white layer of dryness and even hand cream does not help. Lately, I have also realized that my tongue always feels dry and the color is white with a little white bump in the end. I have lost weight about 5 kg for a period of two months. In addition, strong head pain that comes and goes and a painkiller does not help at all, and also suffers from fatigue all the time. I have done a lot of testing of HIV combo Ag-Ab, fourth generation, and all were negative. In addition, two weeks ago (four and a half months of the case), I tested hepatitis B and C (negative result). As well as an antibody test for syphilis SCR by ELISA (negative result). In addition to the above, about a week after the incident, I began to feel a stab at the end of the penis, and I also had a feeling of burning at the end of urination. I have done many urine tests that include PCR from urine for chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, mycoplasma and/or plasma several times, all of which returned negative. About two months ago, I started a transparent discharge from the end of the penis. I repeated the tests, negative, also a general urine test without findings (no leukocytes) and urine culture returned without findings. Here are the questions: Have the tests I performed and returned negative throughout the period clearly indicate that I have not contracted HIV from the case described? Can there be a case in which the virus is not detected and more time is required for further testing? If so, when to do it? In light of all the symptoms I have described, what can it be? What more can be checked that expresses itself in such a way? Are light symptoms recommended to perform a different method test like PCR for example? Has the combo test detected HIV types 1, 2, O? Does the test detect all sub-types and all strains of the virus? Can it be that I have HIV 2 and the test cannot detect antibodies because it can take a longer time? I read that sometimes in rare cases it can take a year to detect enough antibodies and before that all the test will be a false negative, is that really possible? Is there anything new that has emerged in the medical literature at this time that figured out from what all I have said?", "prediction": "For further information consult a dermatologist online -->", "reference": "I have viewed the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your screening tests for HIV are conclusive. A three months intervening period between risk exposure and HIV screening tests (fourth generation HIV antigen-antibody combo test and third-generation HIV antibody screening test) is considered enough for a test to be considered conclusive. There is no need to do another type of test. The combo test is suited to the strains, types and subgroups of HIV prevalent in a particular area and therefore unlikely to miss HIV strain, type or subgroup. HIV 2 can be detected by a combo test and it has the same window period (three months) as it has for HIV 1. Delayed seroconversion is only possible in case of immunosuppression like organic transplant recipients or those on oral steroids. Not otherwise. Your tongue looks normal. The little white bumps, in the end, are circumvallate papillae which are quite normal. The bumps on chest and shoulders are perhaps acne rather than folliculitis whereas the red dots are perhaps cherry angiomas. However, I request you to kindly upload a few more good quality images of the affected areas so that I am able to confirm and guide you better.

So, you need to get the level of vitamin B12 and folic acid done, and supplements, if either one is deficient. Thirdly, you have mild prolapse of the mitral valve in echo which is not usually worrisome but should be kept under observation. So, you get echo done every two to three years.

Many types of research have been done on dream interpretation but there are no conclusions yet as to what suggests what.

Studies have shown the importance of dreams to our health and well-being. In one study, researchers woke subjects just as they were drifting off into REM sleep. They found that those who were not allowed to dream experienced: Increased tension, anxiety, depression, difficulty concentrating, lack of coordination, weight gain, tendency to hallucinate. Nightmares, or bad dreams, are common in children and adults. Often nightmares are caused by: Stress, conflict, and fear, trauma, emotional problems, medication or drug use, illness. If you have a recurring nightmare, your subconscious may be trying to tell you something. Listen to it. If you cannot figure out why you are having bad dreams, and you continue to have them, I can help you figure out what is causing your nightmares and provide tips to put you at ease. In your case, you must be having an emotional issue with your friend and you are stressed due to that. Keep in mind that no matter how scary a nightmare is, it is not real and most likely will not happen to you in real life. Therefore, do not worry about any dreams at all.

Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "Whenever it is cold, I cough. Can you tell me what the problem is? I am 26. I had dry cough from the 10th of last month and it did not go away completely. I was a smoker until the 2nd of last month and then gave up. I smoked for five years. Within the last few weeks, I must have smoked 10 cigarettes. My issue is whenever the temperature is cold, I cough and when it is sunny, I would not. I do not cough too much. It is once or twice in the morning and whole day nothing. Clear mucus and no medicine is required. I just drink hot water and everything becomes fine. Can you tell me what the problem is? I have no chest pain or throat discomfort. No weight loss. Whenever my stomach is gassy, I cough. Please help. I have smoked for five years. What is my cancer chance?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "As you said that you have been smoking for five years and now have cough with clear mucus expectoration, it is most likely due to bronchitis. It is very common to have cough if you smoke more than five cigarettes per day. Also, because of cold weather, it gets aggravated and takes longer to heal. So, better is to stop smoking as you did rightly and take a good expectorant like syrup TusQ-X 10 ml (combination of Ambroxol, Guaifenesin, and Terbutaline) three times a day. Continue with salt water gargles and steam. It will help to loosen and liquefy the cough. If there is no relief even after seven days, better get your chest X-ray done from your family doctor and get treated accordingly. Usually smoking for five years at this age does not cause lung cancer but you should stop smoking. Smokers' cough because of bronchitis is very common.

As you have caries and sensitivity associated, you might not necessarily need an extraction. If the caries has progressed alot, root canal can be done to save your tooth. Betadine Mouthwash, Gargle in lukewarm water 2-3 times a day. Do not worry, use it, if any foul breath that will be covered and your secret will be safe. As you feel uncomfortable using a brush, you can brush using your finger and toothpaste. That way your mouth will also be clean and issue with bristle will also be resolved. You can also take capsule Sporidex 500 mg one apsule BD for 5 days, tablet Zerodol SP 1 tablet BD for 5 days, capsule Pan D one capsule BD before meal for 5 days. You will be needing a scaling to remove any tartar. Once done you can start practising brushing using a soft bristle brush (even a baby brush will do for a start). I am confident you will succeed. But you have to start the habit and you will get used to it, trust me. You can train and motivate yourself by rewarding a candy or anything special.

The problem that I am describing below I have been experiencing for the past 10 days or so. I have a more or less constant headache. It is typically on the right part of the forehead, around the hairline and occurring at the center of my head. The pain is not very severe. It is not throbbing or pounding, though the intensity fluctuates at times, it is never very severe. I also experience a vague sensation of nausea, but no vomiting tendency.

This was detected two years ago. I had visited an ENT specialist for a throat irritation, for which he got me to do a CT scan of my entire head and neck area. I have not had any treatment for sinusitis except some medication for the first week or so after detection. However, I have not really felt a similar headache earlier. I also tend to catch a cold very easily. On several days, I wake up sneezing which resolves on its own as the day progresses or within a couple of days. In the past week also, I had experienced the same few times. I also developed eye styes on both eyes which were painful and watery. I wear spectacles. The power is (–) 5.25. However, I do not experience blurry or double vision at present. I do not feel any difficulty or loss of balance while walking. I have a habit of walking, and even three days ago, I had walked non-stop for 4 km in about 45 mins but did not experience any difficulty or anything unusual during and after the walking. About a month ago, I had been experiencing for few days a strange stiffness in my lower left leg after walking a small distance, a non-specific back pain, and a vague breathing difficulty. My GP advised me to get a chest X-ray, PFT, echocardiography, and ECG done. All the reports were normal. The problems since then have significantly reduced. I am forgetful by nature. Apart from that, I have not noted any memory loss as such. I have no unusual difficulty in concentrating or thinking clearly. I do not experience any speech problem, but I did notice on one occasion that after speaking continuously for few minutes, I was facing some difficulty in speaking more, but that I believe could have been due to psychological reasons. Exactly five months ago, I had got a CT scan of the brain done on the advice of my GP because I had a severe headache one night few days after accidentally bumping my head on a solid low-height door. However, the results were normal, and nothing was found. Uric acid, blood sugar, creatinine, and TSH have been tested within the past eight months, and the reports were normal. However, lipid profile tests revealed high triglycerides (292) for which I took Rosumac 5 for three months, after which the triglycerides (152) were relatively normal.

{"question": "Is there a chance for me to conceive normally after PID treatment? I am completely desperate. After treating yeast infections for years, I made a lab test for whole bacterial microflora in my vagina. The results are awful. I do not have candida at all. The results are: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas spp. 10 6.6 Eubacterium spp. 10 6.0 Atopobium vaginae 10 5.9 Ureaplasma (urealyticum and parvum) 10 5.3. My doctor prescribed me the following treatment: Azithromycin (first week, first day 1 g, second and third day 500 mg, the second week the same). For Gardnerella Tinidazole ( two pills BD for 3 days, actually 2g for one day). He told me to take Tinidazole on different days from Azithromycin. My husband also took pills for only one week Azithromycin and Tinidazole. Also, we take probiotics and vitamins. I also have Fluomizin vaginal tablets for 12 days. My worries are that after three days of Azithromycin, we took Tinidazole but we felt awful after the second day. We could not take the last 1 g because of vomiting, diarrhea, stomach and low back pain. Now I feel better and it is time for the second week of Azithromycin. Can I take the last 1 g of Tinidazole after Azithromycin or just to let go? I have some pain in the low back but this pain appeared two months ago and now I think I have PID or something really bad. I think I have become infertile without knowing it. This ureaplasma should be in me at least for four to five years. For Gardnerella, I am not sure but I have always had some discharge. So definitely things are old. We want to have a baby and now things are not so good for us. If I succeed in treating these infections can I get pregnant naturally or it is better to find medical help without losing time? I am 32 years old. Doctors say nothing here. Actually my doctor told me if the treatment is successful we can try to conceive naturally. But I think these bacterias have injured my reproductive system because of the long-time untreated problem.

My urine sediment is clear and ESR is normal.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "I would like to add a little information here is that PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) mostly is a subsequent result of STD's (sexually transmitted disease) infection (chlamydia and gonorrhea) which actually travel upward along the reproductive tract and may lead to subfertility. These prolonged infections can also cause subfertility but in very severe cases especially recurrent cases and if remain untreated. As you have started treatment, the infection has been cured so you should stop worrying now and start trying to conceive naturally. The chances of getting pregnant spontaneously are quite bright. And as you are 32 years now so you can try spontaneously for at least six months to one year before seeking help. But if it is really concerning for you then there is no harm in seeking help earlier. Secondly, yes you can take Tinidazole after completing Azithromycin course. I hope this helps."}

Last year I was given Mefenamic acid by my doctor to take for the pain and nausea. But, the medicine is not helping me, I still have pain and vomiting. Is there anything else I can take for this?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Dysmenorrhea is not a diagnosis, it is only a symptom. Let me put few possible causes and their evaluation and treatment forward. At this young age, the most common cause is spasmodic dysmenorrhea. The cervix is tight and the blood when trying to make its way during periods, will stretch the canal and cause pain. Pain is only during periods, on day 1 and 2. After that, the main bleeding is over, and pain disappears. If the amount of bleeding is more than normal, you can get a scan to rule out any masses or adhesions. The pain can be controlled by taking birth control pills for six months or more. It will stop ovulation, reduce the amount of blood loss and has no side effects, and it can be taken for any number of years. If you are sexually active, then it can be infection around the uterus know as PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). Vaginal infection is transmitted during sex, so both you and your partner have to be treated at the same time, or else you will get infected again. You may have white or yellow or grayish discharge with or without itching, foul smell, pain during sex. Before treatment, confirm that you are not pregnant. I suggest you try taking the following. Do treat it, as delay may send the infection inwards and may affect both of you. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. Another possibility is endometriosis, every month the blood flows out, but a small fraction also flows into the abdomen through the tubes. This can settle around the uterus and cause adhesions onto the surrounding muscles, ligaments, and bones. This causes throbbing lower abdomen pain before periods, which gradually increases and stays even after periods are over. Sex is very painful. A scan can be done and the restricted mobility of uterus can be seen. This can be solved by reducing flow or stopping periods with hormone pills. Get an ultrasound scan of the pelvis, to rule out any uterine polyp or fibroids. There may be nothing but pain only, gradually increasing every month. Hope I have clarified your doubts, do write back. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"}

Take care. 1.Sun exposure. Skin biopsy Sunblock."}

{"question": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner-lining will fall off.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Migraine headaches are due to blood flow abnormalities in the region of the face and inside the cranium (skull bone). Hence, there is a chance that this eyelid swelling could be due to a migraine. My advice to you is: 1. Since you have been detected to have optic disc asymmetry, kindly follow up with your ophthalmologist every six months or as instructed by him or her. You may also be offered additional testing to confirm if your disc asymmetry needs to be treated or if it should just be monitored. 2. Continue with your anti-migraine medication and watch for any changes in your eyelid puffiness.

{"question": "Can urinary infection be treated through ayurveda? I had two episodes of UTI that led to kidney infection which had been treated with strong antibiotic injections this year and last. I am currently taking Niftran, Silodosin 8 mg along with Ayurvedic medicines like Bangshil, Chandraprabha Vati, Punarnavasa, Sukumaram Kashayam along with Brihatyadi Kashayam and Gokharu Kadha as well as Sudarshan Prostate Plus. I am also taking phytonutrients like Quercetin, Saw Palmetto, Cranberry extract, D-Mannose, Prostaquil, Swedish Pollen Flower Extract, etc. I have also done acupuncture without success. My urologist did an X-ray of the urethra and says that there is a mild bladder neck obstruction and a mildly enlarged prostate because of which I am not able to pass urine fully. My urine flow is also weak (peak flow of 17 ml) and it takes some time for urination to begin. I have a history of chronic testicular pain in the left testis for the last ten years and burning sensation at the tip of the penis (since five years). It was suspected as TB of epididymitis and I was given anti-TB drugs for nine months. But, there was only a mild improvement in pain. I consulted two other urologists and they told me that I do not have TB but chronic non-bacterial prostatitis for which there is no effective treatment in allopathy. I am taking painkillers like Tapentadol along with Duzela for the last five years from a pain specialist. There is an improvement in pain on taking these medicines. I have Grade 2 varicocele in left testicle and the pain is confined to the epididymis and spermatic cord. The pain gets worse after exertion. I also take Daflon on and off. My urologist says a permanent solution is bladder neck incision along with varicocelectomy and spermatic cord denervation. I would like to look at Ayurveda for a few more years because the narrowing of the urethra/bladder neck is mild and the prostate enlargement has been reduced after taking ayurvedic medicines. My biggest concern is that I do not want to get UTI again which may lead to kidney infection. I am able to empty my bladder although the urine flow is weak at times. My libido is low and testosterone level is borderline. I am taking Mildfil 5 mg along with Silodosin. My right testis had atrophied after a hernia surgery about thirty-five years back.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy.

Usually my periods last six days, but this one lasted eight days. I stopped my birth control pill and I have had regular periods since then. So, I am not sure whether it might be a delayed thing after stopping my period. My mother has fibroids, so it might be that. However, as far as I know, I do not seem to have any myself. I recently gained weight (7-8 kg / 15 -17 pounds) in just over two months. I started taking some probiotics three days ago and Vitamin C. I would just like your opinion if it is something to worry about.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "There are several factors that lead to irregular menses. Weight loss or gain can also lead to irregular menses. I do not think you should worry too much about having a period after six days of finishing a normal period. In fact, your ovaries could be suppressed by birth control pills and have not returned back to normal function although you had normal menses. Normally, it takes about three months for your ovaries to gain normal function after taking birth control for several years. Unless you skipped 3 to 4 menses at a time I would not worry too much."}

{"question": "Noticed a growth in my throat. What it could be? Yesterday I felt like something was stuck in my throat. Today, I noticed a growth in my throat. I am 43 years old, non-smoker, and drink one to two glasses of wine per month. Kindly tell me what this could be?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I saw the photo you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Although there is a lot of reflected light, I can make out that you have enlarged tonsils and edematous uvula. However, due to the reflected light and distortion of natural color, I cannot make out whether the area is congested, red or pale. The color is essential to conclude the condition of the mucosa, whether it is inflamed or not. Second, I assume that the only symptom you feel is a sense of something stuck in the throat. There is no pain, fever, cough or thick phlegm, etc. These symptoms if present would indicate infection and you may need antibiotics for that. Hence, in your case, I would like to give the following medicines if you were to come to me in my clinic. A proton pump inhibitor like Prilosec (Omeprazole) or Prevacid (Lansoprazole). These prevent acid reflux into the throat and reduce inflammation and edema inside. Reflux worsens any inflammation in the throat due to constant irritation by the acid that escapes into the esophagus and comes up to the level of the throat. Anti-inflammatory medicines like Chymotrypsin, Trypsin, Bromelain, and Rutoside. These components increase the recovery and hasten healing. They promote mucosal regeneration and reduction of edema. Deslor 5 mg (Desloratadine) will remove any allergic component of the condition. Many a times allergy to any offending agent causes inflammation and enlargement of tonsils. General and supportive measures would be to drink plenty of fluids, avoiding spicy oily and masala foods, drinking plenty of warm water, avoiding smokes and drinks till you are completely better, avoiding the dust outside, wearing a mask if you travel to polluted areas, etc. Suppose there is an infection, the symptoms of which I have told you, then you may need a Macrolide antibiotic, with some decongestants and gargles. Gargles in reflux will worsen or aggravate the symptoms. Hence, I have not suggested gargles now. However, in the event of infection, we will have to tweak the medicines a bit. If you can click a better picture of the throat, without torch light, focussing your smartphone alone with flash, it will be better. Try sending us few more images. Also check for any enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, under the jaw, under the ear, etc. For more information consult an ENT otolaryngologist online -->"}

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

Your neurologist has labeled this as unprovoked seizure since he was not aware of this. Because of this, they may diagnose this as epilepsy, when it is all the more possible that you had a episode of fits due to hypoglycemia and messed up electrolytes due to bulimia. By hiding your bulimia (eating disorder) to the neurologist and GP, you make it a risk of another worse diagnosis of epilepsy. Bulimia is a much simpler disease than epilepsy. My suggestion would be to tell the GP and neurologist the truth and get treated for bulimia and save your future. For further information consult a neurologist online -->"}
{"question": "Do you know the reason for gum pain after temporary crown placement? I am looking for a little advice since I cannot be seen until tomorrow by my dentist. I recently had a root canal on my bottom left tooth (last one at the back in the photo). A few weeks later, I got a temporary crown placed over it. The area beyond the tooth is inflamed and hurts badly. It is causing pain on the side of my tongue and the left side of my throat. I have no idea what could be causing it. I remember them attaching a metal piece back there to keep my mouth dry and open, but not sure if that could be the cause of anything. It did hurt when they did the procedure. What can I do today to relieve the pain? Also, do you know what could be causing it?

It went away for five years and in the year end, I started a keto diet and went into A-Fib twice and converted on my own. Started keto again and went into A-fib twice again and converted on my own. My cardiologist has me on 50 mg Flecainide twice a day. I am also on Prozac 20 mg and Trazadone 400 mg.

Both Prozac and Flecainide increase QTc interval and may predispose for arrhythmia. I would recommend stop continuing their concomitant use. Probably it would be better to start withdrawing them both. But if it is not possible for the moment, you should discuss with your attending doctor to keep the most indispensable drug which in your case seems to be Prozac. In addition, also Trazodone may potentiate the above pro-arrhythmic effect (increase QTc interval). Coming to this point, it would be wise to stop a keto diet for the moment, and also Flecainide. An adjustment of Prozac with Trazodone combination is recommended, for minimizing the potential adverse effects. You should check also thyroid hormone levels, just to be sure they do not influence the recent appearance of atrial fibrillation episodes."}
{"question": "Are Trileptal and Keppra the recommended drug for febrile seizures in a 12-year-old boy? I have a question about my soon to be 12-year-old son. Since he was 1 year old he has had febrile seizures about once a year. They only happen at night. When he is sick during the day I would give him Motrin or Tylenol. Through out the night and he would not have any symptoms. When he did not show signs of being sick that night his fever would spike. Two years ago we had his first video EEG and there were no abnormalities or no concerns. We did MRI, blood tests, and EKG all are normal. He had two seizures this year both while being sick. So the neurologist wanted another EEG. So we did a video EEG. The first night nothing looked wrong so she wanted to keep him another night. During the day he was getting sick he was running a little fever. So that night they choose not to give him Motrin to see if he would have a seizure and he did. It lasted a minute and was a full-body one. They looked over the tape and said there was no evidence of one coming on it came so quickly. They believe (but are not sure) that it came from the frontal lobe. They put him on Keppra for two weeks and then the doctor looked it over with her partners and they decide that Trileptal and Keppra would be what he needs. I happen to total disagree. He has never had a seizure during the day or one without a fever. I feel they so quickly diagnosed him with epilepsy without considering that all his tests are normal. That seizure they saw came on because we didn't give him medicine for his fever. Which to me seems like he has the rare case of febrile seizures lasting till the age of 12 years. He did not have any seizures last year but just two seizures this year. I personally want to try and build his immune system to stop him from getting sick to see if that will prevent his seizures. His father disagrees with me and agrees with the doctor. I believe the side effects of both these medicine out way the actual problem. I am just overwhelmed and stressed. Because I do not know what is the right thing to do? Can febrile seizures last to the age of 12? Is it rare for someone to have a seizure maybe once a year then not have any, then have one the next year? Does the medicine he is on sound too extreme? Please advise.", "prediction": "For further information consult a neurologist online -->", "reference": "I understand your concern. I would say that both you and your doctor are correct. Your doctor diagnosed epilepsy because: 1. Primary epilepsy is more common in those adolescents who had febrile seizures. 2. Along with the fact, the EEG (electroencephalogram) was supportive of epilepsy, because, the febrile seizure would not start in a single region and spread over. Your concern is also justified because: 1. The child is a very classic case of febrile seizures. 2. The night when the child had a seizure, the child had a fever and the anti-pyretic was not given. I think what would have happened is, doctors would have thought that at 12 years it could not be a febrile seizure, along with that they found probable origin in the frontal lobe, so they prescribed AEDs (anti-epileptic drugs). Have patience, as of now continue the medicines. But three months down the line repeat an EEG when he does not have any fever (after taking off the medicines in a controlled environment, if we can do sleep-deprived EEG, would be better) if he has an epilepsy syndrome, the EEG would still be abnormal. This should be able to settle the whole issue."}
{"question": "Should I be prepared for any other tests to check my blood cell levels? I am a 35 year old female. I have hypothyroidism and I am on Synthyroid. Overall, I am healthy. I exercise daily and do not smoke. I have a 15 month old toddler. Throughout my pregnancy, my blood work showed an elevated WBC, but they are under 15 k/mL. They just assumed it was due to being pregnant. At six months postpartum, I noticed a lump on my neck. Further examination and ultrasound showed it was a thyroid nodule. FNA confirmed it was a follicular goiter, which is assumed to be benign. Follow up CBC blood work showed the following: WBC 15.9 k/uL, basophils 10%, IG 9.8%, absolute neutrophil count 8.8 k/uL, absolute basophils 1.6 k/uL, IG ABS 1.65 k/uL. All other counts were within the normal range. I would like to add that I have had a persistent rather annoying headache for almost three months and have developed a weird itching. I itch like crazy and then when I scratch it, it leaves a red chaffed mark that is more than normal. I also feel rather fatigued, but have just assumed it was due to being a new mom. The only other thing I experience is a recurrent tibial stress fracture, which was around four times in 3.5 years. I cannot run more than 5 miles per week in good shoes on a soft surface without inflaming it. This is noteworthy because I have been a runner all of my life and it is a newer thing to me.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

Pregnancy is a state where a woman needs high quality nutrition to ensure development of a healthy baby. It is very important to include green leafy vegetables such as spinach and dill, to improve health and prevent any deficiencies in blood. It would be great if you can include a raw vegetable salad as a mini meal everyday. I usually advise pregnant women to take at least three different fruits everyday. Some fruits like papaya need to be avoided. You can include one serving of protein powder with milk once a day. In addition to healthy food, also take iron and folic acid supplements, calcium and vitamin supplements if necessary as per the doctor's advice. Also, it is very important for a pregnant woman to sleep 8 hours a day. This can be divided as 7.5 hours sleep at night and then a half hour nap after lunch (with a minimum gap of half an hour after food intake).

You need to identify the meaning of his departure in your life. For this, you need to ask yourself a few questions. Is he gone forever from your life? Has he left you? Are crying, being sorry and worried a healthy way to deal with your relationship when you and your partner are going through a tough time in life? What can be other healthy ways or solutions to deal with the situation? These questions will help you redefine the situation of your life. Grief. Here I am advising you some things to cope up better in this crucial time of your relationship. 1. Do share your thoughts and feelings to your partner. 2. Missing your loved one is a positive emotion. Communicate it with your partner. As you mentioned that there are a few moments when you both talk, make this shorter time well productive and good that you both miss talking to each other instead of feeling bad. 3. Find meaning in your life. Think about your interests and what you want to do in life. Now you have more time available to focus and work out to reach your goals. Share your plans with your partner. Get new ideas to spend your time in more productive and healthy way. 4. Be around people instead of spending time alone, because it generates the feeling of loneliness even you are surrounded by lots of people who can help and support you in this hard time of your life. 5. Spend time with your friends and find enjoyment in life. Do whatever you enjoy. It can be anything as listening to music, doing exercise, eating your favorite food, traveling, wearing your favorite dress or aroma, etc. 6. Do a relaxation exercise or deep breathing to calm yourself down. Sit in a comfortable position, take a deep breath, focus on the air going in and out and imagine something positive.

Based on the information you gave, I have suggested some measures as well as some medications. Please wash the toe with lukewarm water and see carefully if any part of the sting (sharp organ of the bee) is left in the toe where it stung. If so you must contact your local doctor who can do the needful steps to remove the sting. If not, then apply some antibacterial cream (like Mupirocin ointment or Betadine ointment) over the blisters. Apply the cream twice daily and wash off with lukewarm water before the next application. Wear comfortable footwear that does not rub over the affected part. Next, to get relief from itching, take an antihistaminic tablet. Antihistaminics that you may take are Levocetirizine 5 mg once a day (if effects wean off, then take twice a day) or Cetirizine 10 mg once a day. If there is pain take a painkiller (Paracetamol 650 mg) if needed. If there is severe swelling and that is increasing with days you need to consult with your doctor to see if it has caused an infection. Increasing pain, pus from the blisters, change of color of surrounding normal skin, fever are some other symptoms showing worsening of the condition or infection. If you are a diabetic with poor sugar control, you run an increased risk of developing an infection. In such a case depending on the severity of infection, anti-bacterial agents have to be instituted. Take rest and do not move the affected toe a lot. Eat plenty of nutritious food and take 4 liters of water per day (this should be the case normally). Especially so now because when you take medicines, the body needs abundant water to take care of metabolism."}

Please find my observations below. The cervical spine x-ray AP (anteroposterior) and lateral views show the following. 1) There is straightening of the neck spine. 2) The alignment of the cervical spine is normal. 3) Mild early degenerative changes are noted in the vertebral bodies of the cervical spine. 4) Intervertebral disc spaces are normal in appearance except a minimal suspicious decrease in disc height C 3-C 4 disc level anteriorly. 5) There is a small bridging osteophyte at C3 anterosuperiorly vs limbus vertebra (rare possibility). This is not a serious concern. 6) Pre-vertebral soft tissues are normal. Impression: There is a possibility of neck muscle spasm and early degenerative changes in the neck spine. Left shoulder x-ray AP view shows normal shoulder joint. 1) The bones are aligned normally and left shoulder joint space is maintained. 2) The scapula, lateral end of clavicle and head of humerus on the left side are normal. I hope your query is answered. The possibility of neck muscle spasm exists with early degenerative changes in neck spine. Pinching of nerves due to disc problems (which might be seen only on MRI cervical spine) cannot be commented up on this x-ray. Further clinical neurological examination of neck spine might reveal any suspected causes for your symptoms. Orthopedic clinical examination of the left shoulder is also suggested to know any restriction of movements and whether any soft tissue structures like rotator cuff requires evaluation by an MRI shoulder. Recommended physiotherapy for few weeks and if there is no improvement or if there is worsening then the concerned area is to be evaluated by MRI scan. There is no need of doing MRI scan for both the regions. MRI scan of the cervical spine is more important in the view of muscle spasm and early degenerative changes.

{"question": "Do ideal BBT raise during ovulation necessary to conceive? I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 17 years old and from there on I was taking Diane 35 to regulate my periods. I was having three months gap between periods and sometimes was regular before treatment. Now I am 25 years old, married and trying to conceive. So I had stopped Diane 35 last month. Since then we tried naturally for a few months. But it did not work out. So we started with treatments. The doctor initially put me on Ovacare myo and other vitamin E tablets using which I got my periods on time. This continued for a month. Next she put me on Ovacare and Endothik and post 15 days, I was put on Duphaston. This too did not help to conceive. Next, my follicle study was done. I was checked on the 12th day where my follicle was not that matured and ET was just 7. I was called on 15th day which showed my follicle in the left ovary was 19 mm and ET was 10.2 mm. The doctor gave me an HCG trigger injection. I was asked to try in this period. So I and my husband had contact from 14th, 15th, 17th day and also 18th day. I was called on the 18th day which revealed that my follicle had ruptured and it was a fresh one since it has some fluid around it. So since it is confirmed ovulation, I expected my temperature to rise. I had not checked my BBT before but when I did it on 20th day, it showed a temperature of 36.1 celcius.

As ovulation was confirmed, you have some chance. Rise in basal body temperature is an unreliable predictor of ovulation, and once you had confirmed ovulation by a more reliable test (ultrasound), there was no need to check BBT. Your body temperature does not give any information regarding the quality of ovulation and there is no need to assign any significance to body temperature in your case. As I already told, you have around 25-30% chance in each ovulatory cycle and there is no reason to lose hope. Just get your husband's semen analysis done if not already done, as normal semen is equally important for pregnancy to happen."}

Nothing to worry at all. I have my reservations for associating vomiting with your functional problems which I feel may be due to gastritis. You do not have any issues with your neck. Please avoid traction to the neck even if you are feeling better with physiotherapy since there is no evidence of any root compression in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). I feel what you can start is Amitriptyline 10 mg every night for a month. Do regular yoga and mindfulness meditation. These things will definitely help you. Do not be preoccupied with your illness. You are absolutely fine. If you have underlying stressors you can contact me."}

Amount of breastmilk secretion depends upon various factors. Important one is demand. If you feed the baby often the whole day today, definitely your secretion will start to increase from the next day as your body will sense the demand and produce more milk. Feed minimum once every 2 hours in the day and once every 3 to 4 hours in the night. Keep hydrated. Drink atleast 3 to 4 litres of water per day as 80 % of breastmilk is water. Take balanced diet.

Unlike natural tooth, the implant does not shift to the empty space but the load bearing capacity changes. Since there would not be a natural tooth to hold the load every time you chew. It is transferred completely to the implant. So, the more implant gets the load the more chances of its failure rate. A removable denture for the lost molar will help distribution of the chewing load. And please do not worry about the facial features.

Moreover, you had mentioned that it is a cracked tooth. I wonder how deep is the crack so that it fits the criteria for root canal treatment. With all these kept in mind, I guess your endodontist has opened up the tooth which is the first step of root canal treatment and packed the canals with medicated paste which will help to heal the abscess. Not all dental abscesses are meant to be lanced off as you think. The endodontic treatment itself is an intraoral approach to reducing the infection of the tooth. Since the tooth pulp chamber is opened up, the pus from the abscess would drain through it. As far as you are not in pain, it is definitely safe to do.

I am so scared of what the bleeding will be like, and I cannot cope.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "How are you doing? I really do not see any reason for you to worry. I feel you are taking those pills unnecessarily. By 50 to 54 years, all ladies enter their menopause. This is a time when all follicles in the ovaries are exhausted and the hormone supply to the inner lining of the uterus is so low that bleeding will not occur at all. This is menopause. But if you keep having these tablets, you are artificially increasing the thickness every month and artificially bleeding by stopping every month. Nothing will happen, just stop the pills, you may have one normal period due to the tablets, then as your body is not producing any further hormone, the inner lining will stay thin and you will not have any more periods. To confirm this, after 2 to 3 weeks of periods, without taking any medications, get a pelvic scan done and note the endometrial thickness. Any thickness of less than 4 mm is normal. I am sure it will be so. You will not have any periods thereafter. To confirm the same in blood, you can test serum AMH (anti-mullerian hormone), the normal level is 1.1 to 3.5 ng/mL. But, if there are no follicles to produce any hormones, blood values will be less than 0.5 ng/mL. If there was some other cause for heavy bleeding, you would not have succeeded in stopping the bleeding with just Norethisterone. So, just cheer up. Just stop the medication, you will do fine. I would advise you to start Calcium and Vitamin D3 tablets to reduce the risk of osteoporosis, which is a risk in every lady after menopause.

{"question": "My son does not like to do his homework even after requesting him. Is beating advisable? My son is 8 years old, and he does not like to do his homework.

Sometimes we beat him if things do not happen as expected. Later, we feel sorry for reprimand or beating. But, for the sake of his future, we console ourselves for behaving in such a way. I wanted to ask if we are doing the right thing? Is beating a child advisable? What should be done if he does not study even after requesting him in a soft voice? Please guide me.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Your experience with your son is common among many parents. The situation can be managed with appropriate support. Find out the reason why your son does not like to do his homework. Is he lazy or having any difficulties with studying, reading, or maths? Does he have any problems with attention and concentration? Discuss with his class teacher about how he is doing his work at school. If he is able to manage well at school, then learning difficulties are less likely. But if he struggles in school as well, mild learning difficulties need to be ruled out. Also, make sure that his vision and hearing are good. Regarding your questions, beating regularly will never be helpful. It is not easy, and it can be frustrating if the child refuses to do as told, but reprimanding and beating in this situation will not help. It will make your child feel negative, make him more stubborn, and make things worse in the long term. Use positive praise and rewards liberally. You can enforce discipline by using negative consequences if a child is not following rules (like limiting the access to TV, games, etc., for a short period). Follow a carrot and stick approach, which does not involve reprimanding or beating the child. It may take some weeks to see the difference, but both parents have to be consistent in your approach. I hope this helps."}

Another sac was also present with cardiac activity. And the doctor said one of the twins got miscarried. To survive the other, I took Prolactin injection and was given Susten tablets. Had one shot of hCG too. I had my NT scan which showed everything normal, nasal bone was present and NT was 1.5 mm. Though the doctor did not suggest any test, I chose to do the double marker test.

As your NT scan was normal with normal appearing NT and nasal bone, this nearly rules out chances of Down's syndrome. Single soft tissue marker at this time is not significant. This could just be an error of measurement of the sonologist. Your age is also of low risk. If I may suggest do have a 3D scan to rule out the anomaly of the baby.

So you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily, high calorie foods. Avoid fried, fast food, egg yellow, non veg consumption, and avoid excessive oil. Do not reuse the cooking oil once used for frying. Have regular exercises like brisk walking or running according to the capacity for atleast 30 minutes a day.

But since you have started gaining power, it can continue for at least 6 more months, so my advise to you will be to continue with intensive physical therapy including muscle stimulation, vitamin B12 intake and come back to me with your neurological charting and MRI films so that i can see and advise you further."}

{"question": "What causes pain in throat while singing high notes? I am a singer, but in recent times, I have not been able to sing high pitch. I develop pain in my throat while singing high notes. I want to show you what happens when I sing using a sample song. Can you diagnose and give treatment after listening to my song?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I treat a lot of singers, so I totally understand what you are going through. To answer your first question, yes it is totally possible to diagnose based on an audio clip of you singing (attachment removed to protect patient identity), though a better method would be a scopy of your voice box. However, I am guessing there are breaks or voice gaps in certain parts when you hit a high note. This is common among male singers. The issue here is that your voice box has 2 vocal cords that vibrate when you sing. The slightest inflammation or irregularity in these vocal cords can produce noticeable changes in a singers voice. The problem here is that the slightest change in the singing voice makes the singer more anxious and he tends to practice harder. Doctors typically prescribe steroids, but that will not help unless you give your voice a rest. Give the vocal cords enough time to heal. There is a lot more I would like to say, but I will try and summarize my advice for you. 1. Total voice rest for 7 days. No speaking, no whispering. 2. Daily concentrated salt water gargles. 3. Steroids (Betnesol) 0.5 mg 2 times a day for 5 days. 4. Pantoprazole 40 every morning for 7 days. 5. After 7 days, try afresh and record the audio, I would love to hear the before and after.

Bariatric or metabolic surgeries alter hormones which control body fat stores and reset set value for fat storage to a lower level. Same hormonal changes are responsible for remission from problems like diabetes. Depending upon your weight, presence or absence of other medical problems, I choose different surgeries.

{"question": "My serum bicarbonate level is low. Is it due to respiratory alkalosis? I have been really sick from last two weeks. Two weeks ago, I had flu symptoms, like headaches, body aches, low fever, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. The chest symptoms were there straight away, and my asthma medicines (Symbicort and Ventolin) were not working from the start. I was taking 200 mg Symbicort twice daily, and Ventolin every three hours or so. After a weekend of being short of breath and tight-chested, I was on my way to my GP just to run my symptoms by him to see if I needed a GP or ER. He told me to take 12 puffs of Ventolin and go straight to the ER. The ER did ECG, chest x-ray, and blood tests. They gave me a nebulizer and Prednisone 50 mg and sent me on my way. I was still short of breath. My chest x-ray was clear, and my blood showed no infection. I did not have any improvement for the week, and I was taking Prednisone, Symbicort, and Ventolin every 2 to 3 hours. I was short of breath all week. I went to another GP, who sent me straight to the ER again. An intern took my history, after three hours of waiting with chest tightness, shortness of breath, mild intermittent sharp chest pain, and lifelong asthma, etc. I also explained that I am a non-wheezing asthmatic, and when I feel at my worst nothing can ever be heard on my chest. Interestingly, he only noted intermittent sharp chest pain not worse on deep inspiration. He did not note chest tightness when breathing. I also told them that for the 10 days, I had coughed more at night but the shortness of breath decreased overnight every night and was gone in the morning and then just gradually increased over the day until it was sober. Then the registrar came and told me that I was to be sent home, as I was taking too much medication and that was causing my heart to race, and that is why I had shortness of breath. I explained that I had shortness of breath before taking lots of medicines and that was why my physician sent me to the hospital the previous day. I did not even know that I could take it more than my usual two puffs every four hours. I was taking medicines as per my brand new asthma plan, which was given to me by my GP. I asked him \"was my heart rate high when the intern tested me?\" To this, he answered, \"I do not know, and I have not looked.\" Then he took my pulse for about three seconds with no watch and said it was 100 per minutes, but my heart rate has been tested over and over all week and was normal every time, that is why I challenged him. He then said that he would keep me in overnight for observations and to await a blood test for a blood clot. The intern had told me they would be doing an ECG and lung function tests. They put me in a room with about eight recliner chairs and no blanket. The nurse attended to everyone else in that room all night and did not even look at me once. She just ignored me. She did not even come close to me. I was awake most of the night. I could hear everything she did with the other patients. My breathing settled a little, but it was still labored all night, and I was coughing all night. They would not let me have my asthma medication. I felt hot and then cold, and I had a migraine. I felt so unwell that I could not get up to reach the button and was just waiting for her to come and help me so that I could tell her. At handover in the morning, she told the next nurse all my information loudly until she came to the bit where she whispered to him that I had been fine all night. I could not believe it. I managed to get some Panadol out of the new nurse, as he did my observation at 7 AM. Then the morning doctor, a young boy, told me he was sending me home, as I was better. I said that my shortness of breath was slowly returning with movement, as I told the doctors at night would happen. He said with asthma; I would be better off being at home as if I caught one of the nasty bugs in there things would get way worse. He said \"you do not look like you are dying, and that is my job to see if you look like you are dying. And if you do not, then you are sent home\". They never gave me an ECG, and they never gave me lung function tests. My discharge report simply stated that I should go home and take my Ventolin if severely short of breath with wheezing. They made up their minds that I was just taking too many medicines or that I had a 10-day long panic attack. My GP asked me if I had been put on any antibiotics, and I told her how the ER said I had no infection. The GP said, but how did they know if they only took blood? She told me that the hospital tests would not show up a chest infection. So she put me on five days of Augmentin, and the headache is gone now and asthma slightly better, but I still feel tightness and short of breath. I have been sitting for an hour and a half and am breathing like I have been on a long walk. This has really scared me. The only message I got from the ER says that do not go there even if you have serious symptoms. I have been sent there by doctors. I have not been believed about my asthma all my life, as I never have a wheeze and since menopause, my asthma has gone from mild to sometimes really bad. Home GP was worried about respiratory alkalosis, as I had been hyperventilating for 10 days. I told the intern and registrar what the GP was concerned about, and they just shrugged like it was unimportant. When I read my discharge summary, I saw my bicarbonate level is low, which indicates the possibility of respiratory alkalosis, does not it? And my eGFR level was low also, which indicates the possibility of a problem with my kidneys. The doctors told me none of this. I am being treated for low vitamin B12 and tested for anemia at the moment by my GP. I would like a second opinion as none of this is making any sense to me, and I am still pretty much just as breathless and just as tight chested when I breath. Between ER doctors and GPs, I have nowhere else to turn. I am now taking Symbicort and Ventolin.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I am sorry for your trouble.

When it comes to my studies, even my parents never forced me to study more than my capacity. All through my school and college, I scored more than 80 %. But when it comes to solving analytical questions and quantitative aptitude, I am very slow when compared to other people. Right from school, I have this tendency to solve the problems slowly or make a lot of mistakes.

Of note, we are planning for a baby too.", "prediction": "For further information consult a neurologist online -->", "reference": "Regarding your concern, I would explain that the catamenial epilepsy is a very specific type of epilepsy where a seizure occur every month at the same time closely related to the menstrual cycle. This type of epilepsy is usually refractory to many epileptic drugs. Anyway, the dose of Levetiracetam that your wife is taking is low. If she does not tolerate this drug, it is not possible to raise the doses. Coming to this point, considering the fact that you are planning to have a baby, I would recommend switching to Lamotrigine starting with very low doses and increasing gradually up to 100 mg per day. Further increase in the dose may be done later up to 200 mg daily if her seizures persist. Another possible treatment would be Acetazolamide taken usually for some days every month before the time when seizures usually occur. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the above medicines. Meanwhile, I would recommend checking her thyroid hormone levels to exclude the possibility of thyroid dysfunction which may trigger seizures. I would also recommend to video register her seizures if possible in order to have a more professional opinion on the type of her seizures. It is not rare to have a normal EEG (electroencephalography) during seizures. That is why video registering is necessary. A prolonged EEG study for a week with video monitoring EEG or a sleep deprivation EEG would give more information on her seizures. Hope you find this answer helpful.

{"question": "The muscles of my left leg get pulled when I move my pelvis. Please help. I am a regular runner and have recently been trying out a new programme running five days per week, with lots of gentle short runs. I have had a few running related injuries in the past year. I got shin splints and peroneal tendonitis on the outside of my left foot for several months, last year. I had physiotherapy for the tendonitis. The physiotherapist discovered that my left hip flexor is weak and the hamstring is too tight on that side, which was causing the foot issues. Last weekend, I seem to have pulled a muscle in my left hip. I did a steep trail run and feel like it was on the downhill that I triggered the injury. It was hurting when I tilted my pelvis forwards. I tried swimming, but the side-to-side tilt of the pelvis caused little sharp pains what felt like inside my pelvis. The sharp pain has now gone, but all of the muscles in my lower back, mainly on the left, but also on the right are now tensing up causing me discomfort. Any ideas about this?

Was the test done right?", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "Let me make a few corrections in the methods done. I have not heard of the methods done. Gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of the pregnancy, which appears in pregnancy only after 26 to 28 weeks, the time when pregnancy hormones are at the highest level. So, any diabetes occurring before 28 weeks is called pregestational diabetes. It is important to know because in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by 28 weeks the baby is fully formed and abnormal sugars cannot lead to any abnormalities in babies other than an increase in birth weight and amniotic fluid. But, if the sugar rises early as in your case (before 28 weeks) this can affect the normal growth of baby's tissue. You will need to be put on Insulin to correct sugar before any damage is done. We do not need to give such challenges in pregnancy to know that your sugar level is high. I would suggest you undergo HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) as this checks your blood sugar level of last three months. Your level should be less than 6.5 %. If it is more than this, then you need to be treated with Insulin. Have fasting blood sugar at the morning after the overnight fast of 8 hours and postprandial sugar after 2 hours of food. These two blood levels will help you decide the doses of Insulin. Also, you can take a second opinion from another doctor.

Depression leads to a lot of other serious health issues. Now coming to your problem, I do not think your problem is related to Biotin use (at least not directly). Biotin is a vitamin, part of vitamin B-complex, which is required for many things (i.e. its deficiency in the body leads to a lot of problems). If you have taken antibiotics for a long time then you might have had a biotin deficiency. This deficiency might have resulted in conjunctivitis, which may cause excessive tearing of eyes. And the treatment is regular supplements of vitamin A and B complex. The other cause and this is one of the most common causes is a blocked nasolacrimal duct. See allergies often leads to swelling of tissues around it and thus the ducts get blocked. When the allergies resolve the ducts open by themselves. But sometimes infection or some other cause may keep it blocked. Thus causing excessive tearing. I do not think other causes of excessive tearing are relevant in your case. You should get your eyes checked by an ophthalmologist. Ask him/her especially to check for nasolacrimal duct blockage. Alternatively, you can also do a warm massage. Massage your part of the nose, on the side of the eye in which excess tearing is there, from the portion near eye to downwards 1 cm for 10 minutes every few hours, if possible with a warm cloth. This might relieve your blockage to some extent. Take care not to injure yourself. I hope this helps."}

There are discussions around adding Wellbutrin as well, I just wanted to get someone else thoughts on that combination of three drugs. Is it safe? Would it be effective? And is it a known combination of drugs which has been specificied before?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Combination antidepressant therapy works better if first line monotherapy has not been effective. I note that you are diagnosed with depression, anxiety and PTSD which can sometimes be challenging but gets better with the right treatment regimen. Different combination or augmentation strategies are used for better response. Usually, it will involves combining different types of antidepressants. Venlafaxine (SNRI type) and Mirtazapine (NaSSA type) is a known combination deemed to be safe and used therapeutically. Adding Wellbutrin (Bupropion) is not used routinely but the rationale is understandable. Bupropion is a NDRI (norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor) type atypical antidepressant. Bupropion is also used in smoking cessation. In your case, Is Bupropion used as an additional augmentation drug or to counteract any side effect like sexual dysfunction? Combination of antidepressants can lead to relatively more side-effects including serotonin syndrome. Decision to combine drugs is made by carefully weighing up the benefits and risks involved. If benefits outweigh the possible risks, it is worthwhile trying the combination cautiously. Risk will be more if you have any pre-existing health problems like hypertension, seizures, etc. Complex decision like this are usually made by psychiatrists in specialist/tertiary medical centres. Whenever combination antidepressants are used, the prescribing consultant and treating team will have to follow up closely, monitoring the dose response and look out for any treatment emergent side effects. Usually there will be regular follow up reviews especially during the initial period. Also always inform or remind if you visit any other doctor about being on combination antidepressants if you are prescribed any other medication (like certain antibiotics) to avoid possible drug interactions. Finally, I believe you are also receiving psychotherapy in addition to medication. In many instances, psychotherapy acts as a good augmentation strategy to manage depression and anxiety disorders."}
{"question": "Why am I getting prolonged foul order vaginal bleeding? I am 23 years old and mostly likely anemic. Before two months, my period lasted longer than normal and the bleeding stopped after 8 to 10 days. My last period started on the correct date and I am still bleeding. I thought it was finished after my normal five day streak, but I leaked blood all over my clothes unexpectedly a day or two later. I did not think much of it and just used tampons until I was sure it was done. I had sex with my boyfriend and discovered that I was still very much bleeding. The strangest thing is the odor graduated from that bloody smell to a foul odor and the color changed on my tampon. It ranges from dark brown to yellowish to green with dabs of bright red. It is also only drawn into two particular places on the tampon, the right and just a small spot in the left center. The tampon is also never drenched in blood; it is a light flow just in those two areas. I am not experiencing any kind of pain or discomfort at all. I have only had unprotected sex with my boyfriend for two years. I know for a fact that he has not had any other sexual partners. I have always been regular, but this is the first time I have ever experienced this.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "You can bleed more sometimes due to irregular menses because of hormonal (chemical) levels of your body and its effect. But, you can bleed also due to cervical erosions and infection there. I personally never recommend tampons. Because, your menstrual blood contains some bacteria and pathogens which can infect. And, when you use tampons due to the collected blood, it gives a media to growth of that bacteria. The body can resist infection up to a limit and as the limit crosses you get signs and symptoms of infection for which you may have to take treatment. Now in your case, foul-smelling discharge and discoloration of the discharge are the signs of infection. Now I have to see, actually where the infection is. So best consult your nearby gynecologist. Let him see where the infection is and what type of discharge actually is. And, if required, then send the discharge for examination. By this we will know the type of infection and can give treatment accordingly. Most probably you are having history, which seems to be likely bacterial vaginosis. It is a mixed infection. You will need to take the antibiotic course for 10 to 15 days and follow some precautions to avoid recurrence. Now, as far as antibiotics are concerned, I have to see the first type and nature of discharge and smell. So, better get consulted nearby for that. Kindly keep up the following precautions: These will help to avoid recurrence. And firstly, complete the drug course to completely eradicate the infection.

So you are describing a few things here, when is the problem of premature ejaculation, second is performance anxiety which is making you overthink, third is low self confidence. Probably that came from the bullying and the trauma that you endured. I would suggest you to start therapy sessions to help you build your confidence which will help you in decreasing the performance anxiety and then it will of course improve the problem of premature ejaculation. If the mental health is stable, sexual issues often resolve. Is there some neurological issues you will need to talk to a neurologist or a urologist for that. Try doing kegel exercise regularly which will help you in strengthening the muscle of pelvis which helps in premature ejaculation. Apart from that you will require therapy sessions to work on your confidence building and reducing anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy will help you in achieving this."}

You are absolutely correct that stoppage of pill causes mid-cycle spotting. Why are you taking birth control if you are trying to conceive? Now coming to your question.

It varies from person to person. Deviry will not interfere with ovulation and since you get regular cycles you can expect to ovulate any time between 12 to 16th day. I am sharing a little extra detail that will help you. Ovulation symptoms that can help you plan intercourse during those fertile days are cervical mucus changes, heightened sense of smell, breast soreness or tenderness, mild pelvic, or lower abdominal pain, light spotting or discharge, libido changes, and changes in the cervix. You should have intercourse on every alternate day from 10 th to 20 th day of your cycle to increase your chances of conception. I hope this helps."}

{"question": "When will swelling due to nephrotic syndrome in a baby reduce? My daughter, 2.8 years old was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome. She had swelling in limbs, private part, stomach, and eyes. She also had slight cold during that time, but no running nose or cough. I have attached her reports. From the last one week, we started medicine, post which the eye swelling (by 90 %), face, hand, legs have reduced and hand have also reduced, but the private part and stomach still have swelling. Overall swelling is still present. Urine check showed improved creatinine results after three days. Her weight has increased 1 kg from the last five days, everyday it is gradually increasing by 200 to 300 gm. Even prior to start of her treatment she had good appetite, she used to eat every few hour either a biscuit or yogurt or a fruit or bread slice. My questions are: In how many days does this swelling reduce? The doctor here suggests albumin infusion if the weight continues to increase or the body swelling does not reduce by five more days. Is it safe to use albumin infusion? Does it require admission into hospital? How many days should we wait before we decide on albumin infusion? Any other alternate to albumin infusion to reduce edema? When will we know if the medicine is working, the doctor say it takes maximum of 30 to know the impact?

This is the nephrotic syndrome of minimal change type as usually comes in the children. The reason behind less improvement in the private area and stomach edema is that steroids are causing central obesity and I believe that this is temporary and will subside when she tapers down the steroids (after remission of the disease). Supposedly steroids are reducing the amount of protein filtered in the kidney and consequently, serum albumin will improve with time without the need for albumin infusion. We might use albumin infusion with diuretics when albumin in blood is less than 2 g/dL, if there is marked hypovolemia or acute pulmonary edema or renal failure. Usually, children are responding to the steroids within 2 to 4 weeks, then after remission, tapering down the dose over about six weeks. Take your daughter to the hospital if there is marked shortness of breath or very low amount of urine or when she is severely unwell. Generally, the course of the disease is benign and it usually shows a good response to the treatment, I advise you to be patient with the doctors."}

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

If your thyroid gland is enlarging it may compress your vocal cords and food pipe and cause your problems like vocal throat squeezed, dumpy voice.

The other possibility is some problem inside your throat like vocal cord nodules, or ulcer, or mass, etc. For this, you need to get upper GI (gastro intestinal tract) endoscopy to know what has happened.

(attachment removed to protect patient identity). Having more lymphocyte count is known as lymphocytosis. 1. Benign or reactive lymphocytosis: Transient nature can be seen in an infectious disease like viral illness. This does not seem to be the case as it persists for a few months. Other causes, that could persist are noninfectious causes like stress, drug reaction, having spleen removed in the past, etc. 2. Malignant lymphocytosis: There is an entity called chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLPD), this is a very slow-growing blood malignancy, usually happens in individuals more than 60-65 years. Some times patients do throw symptoms like low-grade fever, weight loss, anemia, night sweats, etc. They may or may not be associated with low platelet count to anemia which is not the case with your friend. With all this background knowledge, please see which ones is fitting for him. I will discuss the worse scenario because I guess you will be curious otherwise. Having CLPD is less likely as your friend is young, and he is not having anemia or low platelet counts. Regarding the CLPD prognosis, it is one of the very slow-growing entity. We do not treat the early stages, as well as they, are so slow, treating has more drug side effects than the CLPD itself. Getting a flowcytometry is rational in his case. But it is not urgent, you can wait for even few months if there is an issue of lockdown due to Coronavirus.

{"question": "Mom takes Duloxetine for fibromyalgia and is worried about its devastating side effects. Please help. My mother is 53 years old, nondiabetic. She is hypertensive (150-100) and having all over body pain, fatigue and morning stiffness. We consulted a neurologist and she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. She was going about daily activities by using painkiller every day (Innova-MR, Diclofenac, Paracetamol, Chlorzoxazone) before the diagnosis. The prescription for fibromyalgia was Formylin (Methylcobalamin, Pyridoxine H, Folic acid) one tablet in the noon, Duloxetine (gastro-resistant Duloren) 20mg, (Duloxetine 5 mg (0.25 tablet) for first 5 days, 10 mg for the next five days and 20 mg there after). Our main concern is Duloxetine. She has started 5 mg per day dose for a week but is scared to take this medicine as we have come across online references where Duloxetine, Cymbalta actually aggravated the problem, like Duloxetine changes a person's behavior for worse like the person taking it does not remain the same anymore after taking it for few months, becomes emotionally vulnerable and may have suicidal tendencies, etc also. Duloxetine has severe withdrawal problem, the dose has to be tapered very slowly. Changing to different medication becomes very difficult. Is it true? Duloxetine damages critical organs like liver also can cause serotonin syndrome (she is not on any other SSRI, SNRI, psychotropic medicine) For how long she has to take Duloxetine? Will she be ever off on it once she feels better? If the medicine is to be continued, do we have any other safe pharmaceutical alternatives to Duloxetine? Would you recommend any supplements for fibromyalgia? Since it is SNRI, will it adversely affect her blood pressure? She is taking Atenolol 50 mg per day, currently and her BP under control with it. Please advise regarding the safety and efficacy of this drug as there are countless negative reviews about it on youtube and social media.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Welcome to icliniq.com. Regarding your concern, I would explain that morning stiffness is not a typical sign of fibromyalgia, but it could indicate a rheumatological disorder. Coming to this point, considering her slightly elevated erythrosedimentation, I would recommend performing other tests before concluding about fibromyalgia. In this regard, I would recommend performing rheumatoid factor plasma levels, ANA (anti-nuclear antibody) and ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) titer. A nerve conduction study is also necessary to exclude possible neuropathy, although she does not have diabetes. If these tests result normal, she can continue taking Duloxetine and gradually increase the dose up to 60 mg daily (which is the maintenance therapeutic dose). You should not worry so much about this drug. It can be stopped gradually (like the way she is starting it). If it is started slowly, it does not lead to serotonin syndrome, as long as she is not taking any other SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). After stopping this drug, other drugs may be tried like Pregabaline, etc. Anyway, the internet is not the best doctor to ask, because the information is very wide and nonspecific. Every drug has adverse effects, but they usually occur in a low percentage of patients, especially when high doses are used without starting slowly. I hope this helps."}

I am having balanced diet with plenty of meat and kale chips. Since 3 months, I have started taking raw food and prenatal vitamins because of cracks in mouth that would not heal and it seemed like hair was falling out. After over a year of severe insomnia, exhaustion, mouth sores, constant itchiness and RLS issues that made my husband wonder, I went to my doctor last week wondering if it could be hypothyroid. As I have not had periods since 4 years, I did not suspect any anemia. Doctor has done two CBC's. The second one had even lower hemoglobin and hemotocrit levels. My last CBC that was taken 4 years back showed a hb of 14.4 but vitamin B12 results were within normal range. I am attaching all my reports for your reference. Please guide.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "Based on your query and reports (attachments removed to protect patient identity), my opinion is as follows:The low hemoglobin at present is not due to blood loss, it is nutritional. If you look at the iron studies, the iron levels are very low, indicating inadequate iron in body. They can be possibly secondary to reduced intake and may be a cause of malabsorption. As the other vitamin levels are normal, it is more likely reduced iron intake or absorption. The reticulocyte count would increase in case of anemia, if the nutrition too improved. It is staying within the normal range. If you start iron supplements along with vitamin C (for better absorption of iron), you will find your reticulocyte count increasing within 2 weeks. There is no hemolysis or hemorrhage, as in both conditions, if nutrition was adequate, the reticulocyte count would have also increased. At present, all studies including red blood cell volume distribution (RDW), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are iron studies that are pointing towards iron deficiency. Good to know your thyroid profile is good. Insomnia and exhaustion can be easily explained by anemia. Also improve the hydration (take at least 5-6 liters of water per day). Avoid coffee or tea along with food, as it inhibits iron absorption. Adding citrus fruits or vitamin C rich diet during food intake improves iron absorption. At present, nothing to worry except iron deficiency. Supplements of iron with iron fortified food and iron-rich diet should help. Also, take vitamin B-complex supplements, as early changes like ovalocytes are also seen in blood. Both iron and vitamin B-complex supplements to be taken, and within two months, you will return to your normal self. Repeat the reticulocyte count after 15 days to check if it is increasing. 1. Both iron and vitamin B-complex supplements to be taken. 2. Most importantly iron-rich foods to be taken along with vitamin C supplements. 1. Iron-rich diet, iron fortified foods. 2.

{"question": "I am having anxiety and my blood report shows some changes. What should I do? I am a 30-year-old female. My main problem in life seems to be way too much anxiety. That is the main reason I went to the doctor to get a blood test. I got my blood and urine tests reports and these are the things that I think should be noted. Good LDL cholesterol: 106 mg/dl (should be under 130). Good HDL cholesterol: 77 (should be over 40). Low triglycerides 33 mg/dl (should be between 35-149). Normal HbA1C 5.3 % (should be between 4.5-6.2). A bit high average blood glucose 105 mg/dL (should be between 70-100). For my urine test, there was a trace of leukocytes and many bacteria. My blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was a bit low 6 (should be between 7-22). Everything else came out in normal ranges. My question is, could I possibly have adrenal fatigue from my high anxiety and stress levels all the time? With the research I have done so far, my body seems to have been in some sort of infection, but I have not been sick, but I have felt like I was about to get sick about three times in the last month. So I am not sure, but my kidneys may not be working properly, and could not this also be caused by too much anxiety? I may have a thyroid problem because of the low triglycerides. It is either hyperthyroidism or malnutrition, my body is not able to absorb or process nutrients properly. I do not eat a low-fat diet. If I have hyperthyroidism, I do not want to treat the thyroid to mask the symptoms, I want to get rid of the cause. So if the cause of my thyroid problem is anxiety (and all the other health problems I have), would not it be better to treat the actual cause, rather than the symptoms? It also looks like my body is not able to process sugar properly (I have semi-high blood glucose, but basically perfect cholesterol levels). Could this all be a result of my high anxiety, causing physical problems in my body? I prefer to go a natural route to solve my problems. I have heard that taking GABA supplements could lower anxiety levels. However, at this point, I am also open to a prescription form of anti-anxiety medication if necessary. I do not want to take anything to mask my problems. If I take any medicine, I want it to solve my problem. What I could do about it?", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "First of all, your reports are all normal except for some infection in the urine. For that, I advise a test called urine culture sensitivity and revert back with the report. Your triglyceride is slightly low. That does not mean anything. It does not mean you have a problem in absorption or malnutrition or hyperthyroidism.Even your HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) is within the normal limits. So there is no problem in sugar metabolism. Now coming to your query adrenal fatigue, no it does not happen due to excess stress or anxiety. Our body is capable of handing 1000 times the normal stress level. So just relax. I feel there is no problem in your body but there are some psychological issues that might be the cause of your stress and anxiety which need to be addressed. I advise you to consult a psychiatrist for that. I do not think any dietary supplement can help in stress. I advise you to learn yoga and meditation. That will help you a lot. You can also start taking tablet Nexito (Escitalopram) 5 mg every night until you meet your psychiatrist."}

We wanted to talk to someone about the risk factors, what it looks like if he does develop it? If there are things we can do to help prevent it?", "prediction": "For further information consult a psychiatrist online -->", "reference": "If one parent has schizophrenia, there is about a 10 or 12 percent chance for the child to develop the same. (90 percent chance of normal child). If at all the child develops, then some early prodromal symptoms will be apparent in late teens to '20s (15 to 25 years) such as social withdrawal, irritability, decline in academic performance, anxiety or depressive symptoms. These are seen before the proper symptoms of schizophrenia. Also, the use of substances like Cannabis or alcohol will increase the chances of this. If alarming symptoms are noticed early on, then usual treatment is to give antipsychotics for one year or two and then stop. I have seen many patients who have been detected early and then been off medicines for quite some time now. In another one or two decades, there should be greater improvement with the medicines available. So do not worry too much about it and just parent the child regularly and keep a watch on the things I have mentioned above."}
{"question": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner-lining will fall off.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I am only 26 and have always struggled with my weight. Please help.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "I can imagine the level of your frustration regarding your weight. Yes, it is nearly impossible to keep reduce weight and maintain diet and exercise. I may not be able to give you a composite plan of action for your weight reduction since it is not basically a one day consultation task. In fact, it is a long term commitment towards yourself and towards a multidisciplinary team inclusive of a dietician, bariatric endoscopist (gastroenterologist), behavioral therapist, and lastly a bariatric surgeon. So I would give you facts and figures for the existing evidence of weight reduction therapies. Remember your current body mass index BMI is 34.3. The goal of any weight reduction treatment is to reduce weight to optimal ranges where the physical and psychological well being of a person is maintained. Now anybody whose body mass index (BMI) is more than 40 should straight away consider bariatric intervention in the form of endoscopic or surgical modality. And anybody whose BMI is 35 but having other conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes, coronary artery disease (heart disease) or lung dysfunction (lung hypertension and sleep disorders) should undergo interventions. But you see not all person fit into above category. Many have BMI less than 35 (such as in your case) and having very troubling symptoms, among such people individualized approach is employed whether medicinal use or endoscopic or surgical intervention. Diets and regular weight reduction exercises do help to reduce weight by 7 to 10%. All medicines which are currently in use help reduce weight by 10 to 20%. Certain endoscopic bariatric procedures such as balloon placement in stomach and sleeve gastrectomy does help reduce weight around 25% And lastly, surgical procedures such as metallic rings around the stomach via laparoscopy and surgical sleeve gastrectomy, and surgical Roux Y bypass, help to reduce weight by 30 to 35%. The figures are ranges, they vary significantly in individual cases. I also want you to understand, that these interventions should be accompanied with optimal dieting and exercise even after surgery or medicinal therapy. Otherwise, the weight can frequently recur to original ones. This above description is only to make you understand and figure out things. I can recommend you to start with dieting (keeping your calories well below 1500 Kcal daily), running, swimming, and weight lifting on a regular basis. I also suggest you to meet a dietician on icliniq or otherwise in person, to get a diet plan with respect to your calorie requirement. I can suggest you some medicinal treatment, but they are prescription medicine, may not be OTC, and the course has to be taken for at least six months to see the effect. Naltrexone/Bupropion (Contrave) is proven and FDA approved and can be started in your case. But I want you to provide more information about your health, as I can assess your condition first and treat aimfully rather adding more harm to your health. Because these medications have some side effects and they should be kept in mind before giving it therapeutically. I also want to know about family support, any occupational therapist available near your vicinity, your current job status, and medical health insurance, and also information whether the cost of these medicines is covered or not. Until that time you follow up, I want you to get the following blood tests to better know the impact of your obesity on bodily systems. I hope this helps. Obesity. Complete blood count. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), FT3, FT4. Liver function test. Fasting lipid profile. Serum CRP (C-reactive protein). Albumin total protein and AG ratio. Arterial blood gases.

What would be the drawbacks of laser treatment, is it very complicated?", "prediction": "For further information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online -->", "reference": "This is quite a common question youngsters ask. The best answer to this is it depends on you and your daily activities, profession, and lifestyle, etc. For example, if you want to take up professional sports, modeling, enjoy adventure sports, few jobs in the armed forces, getting a surgery done would be quite necessary. On the other hand, if you want to pursue higher studies and professions where you work a lot with computers and work on fine parts like watchmaking, then surgery would put you at a slight disadvantage as it slightly reduces image quality and increases chances of getting dry eye diseases. Some surgeons also prefer wearing glasses as it protects against infection and blood spurts during operations. With the latest equipment and techniques, laser refractive surgery is quite safe, and outcomes are good. The risk involved is very less. Although a power of - 5.0 is on the higher side, we can still expect good results given that your corneas are suitable for the surgery. The main thing to consider is of course long term outcomes are, 1. As a woman, your power will naturally change during pregnancy and lactation, and this happens to all women. Some have more, others less. This is unpredictable. 2. Surgery only corrects you for distance vision. Another natural change in eyes is presbyopia. Here you need to wear reading glasses. So even if you were to get surgery now, you would only remain glasses free for up to around 40 years of age after which you need reading glasses. I hope this answers your doubts. In case you have any further questions please let me know."}
{"question": "I have urinary incontinence, pain and swelling in groin lymph nodes. Kindly help. I am 34 years old male. I started having incontinence problems about 4 to 6 months ago (cause unknown). It began with issues only happening at night while sleeping. A month ago it had progressed to occasionally not even being able to make it to the bathroom before I began to pee. Then, about four weeks or so ago, while having sex with my girlfriend, I ended up with a fairly large cut or tear right underneath the head of the penis. It has happened before.About 2 to 3 weeks ago I somehow ended up with a UTI and yeast infection. For whatever reason, I have not taken it seriously (major depression) and two nights ago I started having pain (then ended up realizing these were little white ulcers that have since begun to spread rapidly). They are under the head of the penis, on my scrotum, and also on the shaft of my penis. Along with that, last night I realized the lymph node in my right groin was significantly swollen and painful as well. Today that became my lymph node in both my right and now my left groin as well.)Finally, when I woke up today I had a huge swollen ring of skin, underneath the head of my penis, along with everything else. I have had this same swollen ring one time before in my life. It is seriously swollen and more ulcers are on that skin as well.

Terifarc may cause some depression, gastric upset or muscle weakness, but generally, it is well tolerated by postmenopausal women. There is no rheumatoid arthritis. Her blood pressure is well controlled and there is no need to change the medication.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "Which medicine, according to you, is best for my psychological disorders? I would like to ask you about treatment recommendations (maybe a few variations) for my condition. I have bipolar disorder type II, social and generalized disorder, and panic disorder. However, I am in constant depression for one year. I do not cycle anymore if I do, my hypomania is very mild and short-lived. Moreover, anxiety is debilitating. I am afraid to go out from home, feeling constant anxiety physical symptoms, such as sweaty palms and feet, chest pain, blood pressure rise, racing heart, and much more. I need something to ease my depression symptoms, but also something that would affect my anxiety in a positive way. My current medications are Lamictal 200 mg, 3x5 mg Tranxene, 5 mg Olanzapine, and 75 mg Venlafaxine. I am unable to take more Venlafaxine because from 150 mg my blood pressure and heart rate were out of control. My previous medications were Lithium, Depakote, Carbamazepine, Anxiolytics, Escitalopram, Zoloft, Quetiapine (which I cannot use because of its negative effects on anxiety and blood pressure, just for me), and Risperidone. I am wondering about Paroxetine, Citalopram and Prozac. If escitalopram 20mg was without any effects for two months, is it reasonable to try out Citalopram? I tried Prozac in past, I could not bear initial side effects but that were different times. Does it affect anxiety disorders from your experience? Paroxetine suits best. Which of these medicines could benefit me the most?", "prediction": "For further information consult a psychiatrist online -->", "reference": "Thank you for your detailed query and history. With regards to your anxiety symptoms, you have tried out SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) class of medications. So, I would like to suggest you try a TCA (tricyclic antidepressants) class of antidepressants like Amitriptyline 75-100 mg, Dosulepine 100 mg, or Nortriptyline 75-100 mg. They are indicated in people who have had partial results with SSRI or SNRI medications. If you do not wish to try out the TCA and coming back to your query about the three medicines, the best results for anxiety will be with Paroxetine between 12.5 mg to 37.5 mg, and Citalopram will also work fine at 20 mg. In addition to these, you can also consider augmenting the action of these by adding Mirtazapine 7.5 mg at night. I would like to suggest that you should consider reducing Olanzapine to 2.5 mg, since you are not in hypomania, and have depressive symptoms. Reduction to 2.5 mg will make it an augmenting agent again for the antidepressant, and also further help with your anxiety issues. Also just to mention, some people do get benefit from having a few sessions of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) from a Clinical Psychologist."}

{"question": "Why do I have dry mouth two months after unprotected oral sex? I am writing hoping you can give me a sigh of relief or a little clarity.

Two months back, I had unprotected oral sex with a guy that lasted for about two minutes. He then penetrated me unprotected for about a minute in which I made him put on a condom. After we were done, he cleaned himself up and penetrated me again for about three minutes. Ten days later, I noticed I had a sore throat and dry cough with a very low temperature and immediately scheduled a visit with my doctor as I was really nervous. I had a slight fever and asked my doctor to perform an STD test. When I got my results back I tested HSV 2 positive. I thought I was fine as far as those results were concerned. However, I read that there was a window period that I needed to test. As time went on I started to have a very upset stomach, gassy, bloated and diarrhea. I am also lactose intolerant. So, I suspected that it was from that. It went away but today I have it again, however, I am taking Penicillin and I heard that this was one of the symptoms. I have a dry mouth which I also heard could be from the Penicillin as well. My period for this month is noticeably lighter than normal which I am freaking out about. I never got a rash or anything or that I noticed. About a week ago, my husband started having diarrhea with an upset stomach and I noticed a rash on his knee which looks more like a bruise than a rash. It was red and purple with no bumps and very small but had no other symptoms. I also noticed that I had a small lymph node in the neck (which is the reason I am on the Clindamycin). I got nervous and decided to go back to the doctor so that she could test me for HIV again and the results were still negative. The lymph node has gotten smaller and stopped hurting, however, I do not see a stone or anything in my mouth that looks like a stone. Now my mouth is really dry not producing any saliva.

{"question": "How to confirm pneumonia? My daughter is suffering from cough for the past four weeks. She started it out very gently and it is getting worse. Last weekend she was coughing almost non-stop. I took her to a Walk-in clinic and they gave her a cough syrup and an antibiotic. I was told to start the antibiotic four days later if she does not get better. I have started the antibiotics after six days. But, she was getting weaker and coughing with choking. I took her back to the doctor. They told me that she might have whooping cough. I was not entirely surprised as she had hypoxia at birth and she did not get that one vaccine: the pertussis. She only got DT. From chest x-ray, we came to know that she had pneumonia too. But, not on both lungs and the x-ray was not entirely white, so it was a smaller pneumonia. By that time we were on day three of the antibiotics. They made a sample test from the nose for whooping cough. I was told that even if she has it the results might come back negative as she took Azithromycin. We were told to wait and see after the antibiotic. The result came back negative. The same night her cough got so bad that she was not getting any air. She was coughing without being able to breathe. She was vomiting and a tone of white long, phlegm or mucus came out with the vomiting. It was white, sticky and lots of it. In the emergency room they turned out that she had bronchospasm. They treated her with Albuterol and steroids. She was put on Albuterol for two hours there, then we came home with an inhaler. She has been using that three to four times a day ever since then. She has been very weak. They checked her again for whooping cough and that too came back negative. She took the second dose of Prednisone three pills. She felt better and was so happy. But, the next day she did not feel that good. Today, she had more coughs and it is a second sound behind the usual cough sound. This second one is like the laryngitis cough, but not barking sound.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your query. For more information consult a general surgeon online -->", "reference": "Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

If there is urinary tract infections with increased frequency of urination, irritation during urination, lower abdominal pain then urine culture will help to diagnose these conditions. 3. Urethritis is damage to the urethra from intercourse or masturbation, irritation from a product such as soap, deodorant, or detergent, and it can also occur due to adenovirus, and genital injuries. 4.

{"question": "I had a fluid-filled swelling on the gum and metallic taste in mouth. Why? Last night I went to bed after feeling fine all day, and when I laid down I got a horrible metallic taste in my mouth. When I felt the bottom gum right at the back there appeared to be a fluid-filled swelling on the top of the gum (there are no teeth in that part of my mouth), and when I looked this morning there seemed to be a whitish cream colored lesion on the inside of the gum and a couple of tiny ones on the top of the gum near to where the swelling is. I contacted my GP, who prescribed a mouthwash over a phone (Benzydamine), saying that it sounded like an ulcer with the constant metallic taste. It kept me awake the whole night.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

{"question": "My wife is not interested in sex. How to initiate a sexual relationship with her? I am a 36 year old male. I am a graduate and working for a MNC company. I got married in before 10 years and it is a love cum arranged marriage. My wife is also working with me. When I was in grade 3, I got introduced to sex by a male teacher. I used to go for tuition and he used me for homosexual. Almost for a year, I was abused by him. From that time I got interest towards sex, especially oral sex. Then, that teacher got transferred to a different school. I could not control the sexual urges, so I use to masturbate from those days when I am alone. But it never stopped me from concentrating on studies. Again, I got a homosexual relation with one of my male friends in grade 8. That relation went on for around six months. Later on during my UG, I got another male friend and had a homosexual relationship for around two years. It will not be very frequent. But, like monthly once or twice. I got the habit of smoking and drinking in my PG days. When I am alone and feel the urge, I used to masturbate. I got a job and I got a chance to stay alone. I used to visit sex workers, but not frequently. I never liked to be in relation with different people. Instead, I like to stick with one girl who understand my feelings and co-operate. I got such a girl, she also a sex worker but she was not like money minded. She got some feeling towards me and gave me good moments in my life. This relation was there for around two years. At the same time, I worked hard and I got many promotions and salary increments.I met a girl in my office, who was brought up by her widow mom. She is not aware of many things, which the same age girls would know. I did not have any wrong intention towards her initially. One thing I like to mention here is that I never showed the other side of me to anyone. People still believe me, I am very good and loyal person. I got attracted towards the girl and we both started loving each other. Love was gentle and tender. She never used to come out with me. She is very scared to roam outside with a male. We got married. But, from the day one, she never used to show interest towards sex. She says sex is not the thing to enjoy and it is a sin. She also will not show any response towards sex. It is making me go crazy at times and I shouted at her. She will only cry and never change her attitude. As these continued, to control my urges I started again with masturbation, watching porn, etc., when I am alone. This was fine for these many days. Nowadays, masturbation is not giving the satisfaction to me. I am in a position like, I need a sex partner, who enjoys sex with me. I am not interested to have sex with multiple people. But, with a single person, who also enjoys sex like me. Another thing I like to mention was, we do not have a child yet. My wife got TB before marriage and her fallopian tubes were blocked. We went for years of treatment and no success. My wife did not show interest towards treatment much and we stopped it after two years. As she cannot bear a child for me and cannot sexually satisfy me, she is asking me to marry another girl. My situation is like I cannot cope up with her and proceed further in life due to unfulfilled urges and at the same time I cannot able to accept her offer and divorce her. If I leave her she will be left alone in her life. She is a good girl otherwise like she takes care of me when I fall ill, she prepares good food and when my parents use to visit us she will take care of them well. Now, every night is hell for me.

I understand her point to encourage you with a second marriage, but rather than opting for it you can see a marriage counselor. In my opinion, much can be helped with proper counseling in regard to regular sex and bearing children. Regarding your problem, I do not think it is abnormal.

My chiropractor found my stomach is pushed up very high, next to my esophagus. He was able to push it back down, but with a lot of painful force and manipulation. Ever since I have been getting sicker and sicker with episodes that are so debilitating that I can no longer work. They happened occasionally at first, but now three to four times each day (always upon weakening) and last for hours at a time. It begins in my mid-abdomen. I feel and see pulsating in my abdomen and get a wet sensation as though the fluid is leaking out of my chest or belly. If I push on that area (or usually all by itself), I get an instant rush of blood to my head and start to feel fuzzy. My face turns bright red and becomes so hot that I get nauseous. The redness sometimes stays, sometimes goes away. But what always follows immediately is intense heat throughout my whole body, like my spine, muscles, and nerves are on fire everywhere from my head to my palms to my mouth to the soles of my feet. Then I start to shake uncontrollably, with the shakes progressing into worse tremors in my left thigh and right biceps. The shaking definitely seems to start from the abdomen or groin area. If I press my thighs or groin or even touch them lightly, my legs increase in spasticity. When these episodes end, I feel completely wiped out (blurry vision and hard, tired muscles), but I never return to normal. I always feel shaky and not myself. I have been at the doctor's twice when these episodes were happening. The first time my BP was a bit high at 130 mmHg (usually I am spot on at 120/80 mmHg) and the other time my vitals did not change at all during the episode. Other information, possibly related: My left thigh and knee are filled with fluid, but my orthopedist attributes that to a popliteal cyst (is that the same as an aneurysm?) he found behind my knee. He gave me a Cortisone injection four days ago, but so far the swelling in the front of my thigh, my knee, and my calf have not gone down. I was also told that I have an umbilical hernia and two inguinal hernias. I also have a history of localized scleroderma, which I understand, can weaken the connective tissues and blood vessels. Recent blood tests for ANA and rheumatoid factor both came back negative. Not sure how that is possible when I was diagnosed with a positive ANA and localized scleroderma (Morphea) 25 years ago. I am very scared. Do you have any idea of what is happening to me? Or what tests I should have done? Not sure if this is GI related, vascular, rheumatology, etc. But I need to find a way to calm these spells so I can go back to work.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Welcome to icliniq.com. Well, the symptoms do sound a bit different and something we need to look into. As per the issues, I hope they have looked into any form of venous obstruction i.e. super vein obstruction. Any compression on that vein can cause the face to turn red and a bit of low blood pressure. But it is a very rare thing to happen. A CT (computed tomography) of the chest would be advisable to rule out this compression causing the symptoms. But yes, it does not explain what is happening in your legs. The symptoms do see to be of hypersensitivity. Do these symptoms happen after a hot water bath as well? Do you feel any shock-like sensation from the neck below? For the popliteal cyst, it is a bakers cyst. It is totally different from aneurysm, as aneurysm will be pulsating and moreover it is a very unusual site for it to happen. Normally, it does respond to injection Cortisone, but sometimes if the injection does not go in the right place it can persist. You may need to repeat the injection after a month or so incase it is persisting. As for localized scleroderma, it is a benign form and ANA can go negative at times. We can either call it a lab error or at times the body does act through to make it negative. How much has been the skin extent in your scleroderma though? To summarize, we need to figure out a cause for your symptoms. Scleroderma does not explain it. We need to see if it is an SVC (superior vena cava) obstruction. Of the rarest cause, with the spasticity happening in your legs on touching I would like to rule out any brain condition as well. These sound like paroxysmal dyskinesia. I hope this helps."}

{"question": "My left tonsil is swollen, and I have a severe post-nasal drip from a month. Please help. I am a 46 year old female, and I am a non-smoker and non-drinker. I received a kidney transplant 16 years ago. I am in a very good health, and I had no bouts of rejection. I eat well and exercise. I just started a new job in another city, so I had to move. Two months back, everyone in the office seemed to be sick, and they had lots of coughing. So, when I noticed a swollen left tonsil approximately a month ago, I was surprised as I had never experienced this in 46 years, but yet with everyone seemingly sick, I was not terribly surprised. I did not feel much discomfort the first week, and I felt like I had a cold. So, I went to a walk-in clinic. The doctor swabbed my throat, but I had no strep infection. So, no antibiotics were given. The doctor told me to gargle with salt water. Approximately a week later, I woke up in the middle of the night, and my throat was very sore. I also was starting to feel unwell and believed I was starting to get a bad sinus infection. I have had several since my transplant, but not recently within the past year or two. Post-nasal drip has been excessive along with general malaise and extreme fatigue. This has been the sickest I have been since pre-transplant 16 years ago. I went back to the walk-in clinic. The doctor prescribed Clindamycin for 10 days at 300 mg. He also sent me for a throat ultrasound due to enlarged submaxillary glands to see if there was an abscess. The medication made me sick at first and a bit of facial swelling, but after 2 to 3 days, my body got used to it, and it seemed to start helping. I was very sick overall for about a week and then started to feel back to normal including energy and no more malaise. The sore throat seemed to dissipate. However, my left tonsil was still swollen. I started to experience blood in my phlegm first thing in the morning when I would clear my throat and only in the morning. My ultrasound came back normal. I finished the 10-day course of antibiotics. My throat started to become sore again, only on the left side. It has been over a month, and it is still swollen. So, I went back to the walk-in clinic, and this time the doctor prescribed Azithromycin 250. Again, I gargled with warm salt water. And I just started the new antibiotics. But, I still do not feel better. I have never had a swollen tonsil in my 46 years nor am I one to deal with a sore throat for any more than a day or two, and I am now going on at least 2.5 weeks, I feel it every time I swallow and yet eating does not bother me. I have ingested more throat lozenges, popsicles, and gargled to no avail. I am becoming frustrated and concerned at the same time. Please help. Two years ago, I developed vertigo suddenly when on vacation. I had extreme allergy attack with a choking post-nasal drip at night. I never had allergies before. The doctor at that time said it was a bad year for non-allergy sufferers and worse for those with allergies already. I was prescribed nasal steroids.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "Enlargement of tonsil on one side is not usually a good sign. Infectious or inflammatory causes usually cause enlargement on both sides. The constant post-nasal drip points to some cause in the sinuses. Constant post-nasal drip can act as a cause for enlargement of tonsils, like in your case. To know more about the tonsillar swelling, I suggest you get a CT scan of the head and neck. I want to rule out any pathology in the sinuses, as well as clearly delineate the extent of the tonsil swelling. Until then, I suggest using Benzydamine mouth gargle, especially after meals rather than plain warm saline gargles for the throat infection. I suggest you also take an antacid medication, Pantoprazole 40 mg, twice daily before food. This will prevent any acidic irritation of the throat mucosa. Secondly, I would suggest some anti-inflammatory medicines like Trypsin and Chymotrypsin tablets to remove the swelling. But, you must check with your doctor if they can be administered to you since you have had a kidney transplant. Meanwhile, the pain can be kept in check by using Tylenol (Acetaminophen), once or twice a day. I would like to see a picture of your throat. If you can click one with open mouth showing details about the tonsils, posterior pharyngeal wall, and the oropharynx, it will be helpful for us to see the swollen tonsil. In renal transplant patients, we encounter fungal infections more. So, I want to rule that out in you. Do revert with the necessary details.

{"question": "I had a leg injury 20 days back, please explain my MRI reports. I am a 33 year old male, who presents with a Lisfranc injury. I had a leg injury 20 days back. I was told it was a minor sprain, and I tried to walk on my foot, but it is paining a lot. I am currently using non-weight bearing boots, and would not be able to see my surgeon for another six days. I got an MRI of the leg, can you please make me understand the findings? The MRI reads, both the dorsal and plantar bundles of Lisfranc ligaments are intact and normal in appearance. The first and second TMT joints are normal. There has been a capsular injury involving the dorsal aspect of the fourth TMT joint. Edema overlies the dorsum of the foot in this region. There is no associated fracture demonstrated. Mild edema is also seen in the adjacent cuboid at its articulation with the fifth metatarsal. The third TMT joint is normal and the shafts of the metatarsals are normal. The navicular cuneiform joint complex is normal. The extensor tendons are well maintained and the flexor tendons are intact. Capsular injury involving the dorsal aspect of the fourth TMT joint with adjacent bone contusions and intact Lisfranc ligament.

I am sorry firstly to hear that your daughter is being diagnosed with Erb's palsy. Well, I would suggest you to continue physiotherapy for atleast three days a week as it will be of good help for her. Usually, cases with Erb's palsy recovers well when they perform physiotherapy for over longer periods in infants. Firstly, in the initial stages the physiotherapist will do passive movements of the limb but off late it will be progressed to toy reaching where she can use the maximum of her efforts and learn proper movements. We need to teach brain the movement. In between there might be a use of infant stimulation which will be of use to activate the muscles which are not active. A competitive physiotherapist for using the stimulation over an infant is needed as they have to analyze to which muscle it has to be given. Also a precaution has to be taken while applying a stimulation to the infant as the kid might not like it, so a competitive physiotherapist is a must for this. In my clinical practice over a period of 12 years I have seen many infants with Erb's palsy. They have responded well with the physiotherapy and with careful attention. Breech delivery. Erb's palsy.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it?

{"question": "What is the treatment option for broken molar tooth? Ten years ago, I had a molar break nearly in half. At that time, I tried to do the correct thing. I went to a clinic and had a temporary filling. I switched jobs within a few months, acquired actual dental insurance and went to a clinic. I got my teeth cleaned, a couple of fillings and set up for a root canal on my broken tooth. During and after the root canal, I was out of it. I have severe TMJ and had to be medicated. It was not until a few days later when I received the bill, that I even realized the procedure did not include the cost of a crown. So I have not had my crown as it was expensive. There is not an excuse that is acceptable, but the fact remains that I have not done anything about this for a decade. Between that time and now, I have switched jobs and no longer have any provided insurance. I stopped chewing on one side of my mouth a few years ago. My broken tooth has died and fallen out a piece at a time. There is about a quarter left. The teeth next to it are in bad shape. My gums are swollen and surely infected. I am aware of the likeliness of deeper infection. I have zero dental insurance and minimal health insurance. I am highly anxious in general and suffer from irrational fears. For reasons I cannot explain, I am terrified of visiting doctors, and especially dentists (no offense). I also have very little in the way of expendable income and I cannot afford to hop from doctor to doctor paying each along the way. I have no clue where to start. But I know I need to. I just have no one to ask. I am scared. What do I do? Can I get to see my general physician about this? I know they will have to refer me, but going straight to a dentist will surely cost a great deal more. I need step one and I do not know what it is?", "prediction": "For further information consult a dentist online -->", "reference": "You need to show to a dentist itself as the teeth is broken and only a quarter of actual size should be removed. The tooth next to this which has cavity should also be filled or maybe would require root canal treatment. You can delay the crown placement if you do not have money for. Otherwise just extracting or pulling out those infected teeth will give you much relief and it would be cheaper also, than trying to restore it. 1. Use Saline or Betadine gargle for at least twice a day after food for a month to reduce the gum infection. I can prescribe you antibiotics but I do not know whether you will be able to buy them there without a prescription. 2. Amoxicillin 500 mg thrice for five days would reduce the underlying infection and give you relief for a month or so. (stop if you have any allergic reaction). 3. You can take some painkillers and antacids if required. As a last resort if you do not have any money for the treatment and also do not have insurance, just use Betadine gargle and try to buy the above antibiotic and use it for five days. Then when you have money show to a dentist and get those teeth pulled out or restored. Maintain proper hygiene so that at least other teeth do not get infected. Use warm saline gargling as much as possible and for as long as possible. I hope this helps."}

They are cosmetically unfavorable because they have to be applied thickly and evenly so they are visible on the applied skin whereas chemical sunscreen like octocrylene, etc., are not visible.

The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

{"question": "Please give some advise to improve my hemoglobin level. Recently, I had RARP surgery for prostate cancer. My Hb level post surgery fell to 10.8 and I was advised to stay on iron supplement Dexorange Syrup one teaspoon thrice daily after meals. In view of ongoing treatment for erosive gastritis, which is now under control, the Iron supplement was started three months ago. Then, my Hb level has improved to 12.5. I had a CBC, folic acid and iron study and I have enclosed the reports for your reference. I am a vegetarian. Please advise further course of action as I have been advised to stop the Dexorange syrup after three weeks and continue with iron-rich diet. My gastroenterologist is not in favor of long-term usage of Iron supplements. The stomach ulcers due to H.pylori have been treated and stomach lining restored. Currently, I am taking Nexpro 40 mg in the empty stomach and Librax once at night. My CBC report issued an alert for anisocytosis. My amylase level is around 174 U/L, but pancreatitis and bile duct obstruction have been ruled out. I am taking Unienzyme tablet in the morning and night along with one probiotic capsule Vizylac. Please advise if any attention or investigation or treatment required further. Thank you.", "prediction": "For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->", "reference": "Based on your query and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), my opinion is as follows: Repeat hemoglobin after three months.

{"question": "I have a dull headache. Can it be related to thyroid issue? I have been diagnosed with Hashimoto's five months ago. My anti-TPO and anti-TG were 115 and 33 respectively. My TSH was 1.5 and FT4 1.1, so normal function. Two months ago, I started having palpitations and tested my thyroid again. TSH was 0.0018 (suppressed), FT4 2.66 and FT3 7.8. I was hyperthyroid, so I had the TRAb test and it was 5.9. So, I was diagnosed with Graves' and overt hyperthyroidism. I was put on 15 mg Methimazole and 6 weeks later retested my thyroid and my results are, TSH 0.0026, FT4 0.86. So, normal but low range and FT3 is 2.8. Over the last 2-3 days including before these tests, I started having a nasty dull head pressure and lack of focus, similar to what I have had a couple of years ago when my TSH came out 4.1. I also had fatigue and brain fog, which I do not have now. I feel this pressure or tension around my ears, nose, head and throat. I feel my jaw and upper throat tense, had nightmares, irascible and emotionally unstable. It all started rather suddenly. Can it be thyroid related? It is my only known health issue. I do not feel sick and I do not have fever too. But, this sensation in my head and throat annoys me and makes me very anxious. Could it be related to my FT4 going too low? And why is my TSH still suppressed? Why should not it rise with this FT4? Are the TRAb antibodies keeping it suppressed? I will now half my Methimazole dosage to 7.5 mg per day for another three weeks and test again. Does this sound right? Do you have any other advice for me with these symptoms and test results? Please let me know if you need any more information. Thank you so much.", "prediction": "For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->", "reference": "You have written a very detailed and engrossing history. Well done!
